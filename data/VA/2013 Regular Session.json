The measure (i) eliminates the 50 basis point performance incentive that has been available to utilities that attain the renewable energy portfolio standard goals; (ii) replaces the provision that has authorized the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to adopt a performance incentive that may increase or decrease a utility's combined rate of return by up to 100 basis points, based on a comparison of the utility's generating plant performance, customer service, and operating efficiency with nationally recognized standards, with a provision that authorizes the SCC to increase or decrease the utility's combined rate of return consistent with its precedent for incumbent electric utilities prior to the 2007 re-regulation legislation; (iii) increases the threshold for determining whether the utility's earned combined rate of return on common equity is excessive or insufficient, for test periods commencing after December 31, 2012, from 50 basis points above or below the return determined by the SCC to 70 basis points above or below such return; (iv) eliminates the provision that requires the SCC, when it determines that rates should be revised or credits applied to customers' bills, to combine a rate adjustment clause previously implemented to recover transmission-related costs with the utility's costs, revenues, and investments until the amounts that are the subject of the rate adjustment clause are fully recovered; (v) eliminates the provision that authorizes the SCC to include in a rate adjustment clause for environmental costs the enhanced rate of return on common equity that is provided for new generation facilities if the environmental costs reduce the need for constructing new generation facilities by enabling the continued operation of existing generation facilities; (vi) requires a utility seeking approval to construct a generating facility to demonstrate that it has considered and weighed alternative options, including third-party market alternatives, in its selection process; (vii) eliminates the authorization for a utility to earn an enhanced rate of return on the costs of a new generation facility during the first portion of its service life if the facility does not utilize nuclear power or offshore wind, unless the SCC has approved a rate adjustment clause for the facility by July 1, 2013, or the utility filed a petition therefor on or before January 1, 2013; (viii) reduces the potential enhanced rate of return on the costs of a new generation facility utilizing nuclear power or offshore wind from 200 to 100 basis points; (ix) requires certain costs related to early retirement of generation plants, severe weather events, and natural disasters to be deemed to have been recovered through customer rates during the test period under review unless doing so would place the utility in an under-earning position, in which event the SCC is required to authorize deferred recovery of such costs and allow the utility to amortize and recover the deferred costs over future periods; and (x) directs that the fair combined rate of return on common equity determined by the SCC in a biennial rate review shall apply to the entire two successive 12-month test periods ending December 31 immediately preceding the year of the utility's subsequent biennial review filing for purposes of reviewing the utility's earnings on its rates for generation and distribution services. The measure also requires Appalachian Power, referred to as a Phase I utility, to delay the filing of its next biennial review from March 31, 2013, until March 31, 2014.

In addition, the measure provides that for any test period commencing after December 31, 2012, for Dominion, referred to as a Phase II Utility, and after December 31, 2013, for Appalachian Power, if the utility has, during the test period or periods under review, earned below the return determined for the utility, the utility may petition the State Corporation Commission for approval of an increase in rates as if it had earned more than 70 basis points below a fair combined rate of return.

If the federal government does not pass legislation authorizing the Commonwealth and other states to collect sales taxes from retail dealers located outside the respective state by January 1, 2015, then the motor fuels tax imposed on gasoline will be raised from 3.5% to 5.1% (the motor fuels tax on diesel fuel will remain at 6%, but the diesel fuel refund for passenger cars, pickup or panel trucks, and trucks weighing less than 10,000 pounds will be in an amount equal to a 0.9% tax paid). If the federal government passes such legislation after January 1, 2015, the rate of tax on gasoline will revert to 3.5%. The bill amends the tax on the sale of motor vehicles (the \"titling tax\"). Currently, the titling tax is 3%. A new rate of 4.15% will be phased in over four years. The bill increases the share of existing general sales and use tax revenues used for transportation from a 0.50% sales and use tax to a 0.675% sales and use tax, phased in over four years. The additional allocation will be deposited into the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund. The bill also allocates the revenues from an existing 0.125% sales and use tax to public education. The bill imposes additional state taxes and a fee in Planning Districts meeting certain population, motor vehicle registration, and transit ridership criteria. The additional taxes and fee are a retail sales tax of 0.70%, a 2.1% tax on wholesale distributors of motor fuels, a 2.0% transient occupancy tax, and a fee on grantors of real property equal to $0.15 per $100 of the value of the real property sold by such persons. The transient occupancy tax and grantor's fee currently would apply only in the Northern Virginia Planning District, and the tax on wholesale distributors of motor fuels currently would apply only in the Hampton Roads Planning District (under current law, the same tax on wholesale distributors is imposed in the Northern Virginia Plannning District). The retail sales tax currenty would apply in both the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads Planning Districts. The additional revenues generated in the Northern Virginia Planning District are deposited into a Northern Virginia Transportation Authority Fund, with 30% of the funds being distributed to the member localities for use on transportation projects, and the remainder to be used for regional transportation projects. The additional revenues generated in the Hampton Roads Planning District are deposited into a Hampton Roads Construction Fund to be used soley for new construction projects on new or existing roads, bridges, and tunnels, as approved by the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization. The 0.70% state sales and use taxes in Planning Districts are in addition to the 0.3% state sales and use tax increase that applies throughout the Commonwealth. Of the increased revenues in the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund, $100 million in fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016 will be dedicated to Phase II of the Dulles Metrorail Extension Project, subject to certain conditions. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, $20 million dollars from the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund will be deposited into the Route 58 Corridor Development Fund. The bill prohibits tolling on Interstate 95 south of Fredericksburg without prior approval of the General Assembly. The bill also makes several technical changes related to the administration of these various provisions."}, "1179": {"bill_id": 461687, "number": "HB2315", "change_hash": "07b2d9f5f39ca755ca34b3bc075e0cfa", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB2315/2013", "status_date": "2013-03-18", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-03-18", "last_action": "Governor: Acts of Assembly Chapter text (CHAP0517)", "title": "Volunteer Rescue Squads, Va Association of; to submit an annual financial report on use of funds.", "description": "Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads; report to the State Emergency Medical Services Advisory Board.

The measure also provides that the supplier's infrastructure costs include, in addition to the direct costs associated with the supplier's infrastructure, an offset for any benefits derived from any net energy metering provided by eligible customer-generators to the supplier.

All contributions deferred would be required to be repaid within 10 years at an annual interest rate equal to the current actuarially calculated long-term rate of return as determined by VRS.
