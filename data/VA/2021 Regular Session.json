Replaces the Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act with a system under which retail customers will be able to purchase electricity from the retail electric provider of their choice. The measure requires each incumbent investor-owned utility, electric cooperative, and municipal electric authority by January 10, 2021, to file with the State Corporation Commission a plan by which it will separate its customer energy services business activities that are otherwise also already widely available in the competitive market from its regulated utility activities by September 1, 2021, and to separate its business activities into an electric distribution utility, an electric transmission utility, a power generation company, and a retail electric provider, or into a single electric transmission and distribution utility, by January 1, 2022. Such separation may be accomplished by creating separate investor-owned companies, cooperatives, or municipal electric authorities or through the sale of assets to a third party. The measure provides consumer safeguards, including requirements that a retail customer have the right to choose a retail electric provider and to have access to providers of energy efficiency services, to on-site distributed generation, and to providers of energy generated by renewable energy resources. When customer choice commences, a retail electric provider that is serving a retail customer on December 31, 2021, may continue to serve that customer until the customer chooses service from a different retail electric provider. If the Commission determines that a region served by an incumbent electric utility is unable to offer fair competition and reliable service to all retail customer classes on January 1, 2022, the measure requires the Commission to delay customer choice for the region. The Commission may use pilot projects to evaluate the ability of each region served by an incumbent electric utility to implement customer choice. After January 1, 2022, an incumbent electric utility may not sell electricity or otherwise participate in the market for electricity except for the purpose of buying electricity to serve its own needs or while competition for the region served by the utility is delayed. The measure requires the Commission to designate, through a bid process or other method, retail electric providers to serve as providers of last resort, which will be required to offer a customer retail service at a rate approved by the Commission. Metering services will be provided by an area's incumbent electric utility or the electric distribution utility separated from the incumbent electric utility. Each electric distribution utility is required to bill a customer's retail electric provider for non-bypassable delivery charges equal to the sum of electric utility charges by customer class based on a forecasted 2022 test year and the generic customer classes and generic rate design established by the Commission and a system benefit fund fee. The system benefit fund fee will be allocated to retail electric customers on the basis of the amount of kilowatt hours used and will be set by the Commission in an amount to cover the costs of customer education programs, a percentage of income payment plan, weatherization programs, and energy efficiency programs. The measure requires electric distribution utilities to deploy advanced metering and meter information networks for all of their residential customers and nonresidential customers within three years after the start date of customer choice, the costs of which shall be recovered by a non-bypassable surcharge. The measure authorizes the Commission to mitigate market power abuses associated with the transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity. The measure requires the Commission to establish by March 1, 2021, an independent distribution system operator (IDSO) that will operate and plan the distribution systems of all electric distribution utilities and perform other duties, including ensuring open access to the distribution systems for all buyers and sellers of electricity on nondiscriminatory terms. The IDSO's costs will be recovered through a reasonable and competitively neutral rate or fee that is within a range determined by the Commission. Distribution utilities are required to transfer the management and control of their distribution system assets to the IDSO and to observe the IDSO's policies, rules, guidelines, and procedures. By January 1, 2021, each electric utility is required to file proposed tariffs for its open-access distribution service, and the Commission is required to set tariffs for electric utility services and the system benefit fund fee for each utility by January 1, 2022. The rates are required to afford the utility a reasonable opportunity to recover its reasonable costs and a reasonable rate of return, fairly allocate the utility's costs among customers, and provide an appropriate price signal to customers with respect to renewable energy. The measure requires incumbent retail electric providers to make available from January 1, 2022, until January 1, 2027, \"price to beat rates\" to residential and small commercial retail electric customers in its former service area that are six percent less than the incumbent electric utility's corresponding average rates that were in effect on January 1, 2019, adjusted to reflect the wholesale power cost basis. Incumbent retail electric providers are prohibited from charging these customers rates that are different from the price to beat until the earlier of 36 months after the date customer choice is introduced or the date that at least 40 percent of the electric power consumed in the utility's service area before customer choice is committed to be served by independent retail electric providers. The measure requires that retail electric providers be certified by the Commission and that aggregators register with the Commission. The measure establishes a Percentage of Income Payment Plan (PIPP) providing financial assistance for residential customers whose household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal nonfarm poverty level. Under the PIPP, the level of payment responsibility to be borne by an eligible customer is based on a percentage of the customer's income. Participants in the PIPP will receive a monthly credit for the amount by which the participant's actual monthly bill for electric service or the statewide average monthly bill amount for that month, whichever is less, exceeds 10 percent of the participant's monthly household income if the participant's residence's primary source of space heating is electricity or six percent of the participant's monthly household income if the participant's residence's primary source of space heating is natural gas or propane. The Commission is also required to establish and implement a home weatherization program. The measure requires the IDSO to identify the achievable cost-effective energy efficiency potential for each electric distribution utility service area in the Commonwealth and, if it determines that an electric distribution utility service area has achievable cost-effective energy efficiency potential, to issue a solicitation for bids from persons to develop and implement energy efficiency programs that achieve this potential. The measure authorizes any distributed electricity generation owner to connect distributed electricity generation to an electric distribution utility system and authorizes a retail electric provider to contract with a distributed electricity generation owner to provide that surplus electricity produced by distributed electricity generation is made available for sale to the retail electric provider and that the net value of that surplus electricity valued at the energy price at the location of the distributed electricity generator is credited to the distributed electricity generation owner. The measure provides that electric authorities and municipalities that provide electric transmission or distribution service are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The measure recasts the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation as the Commission on Energy Reform and extends its sunset until July 1, 2022. The measure eliminates the requirement that the Commission find that a utility's proposed construction of a new generation facility of 100 megawatts or more is necessary to enable the utility to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities at reasonable and just rates. The measure retains net energy metering programs with provisions that revise the compensation structure for the energy produced by distributed customer-generators to implement time-based and location-based market prices. The measure provides that a person that sells electric energy generated from an onsite distributed electric generation facility to a customer pursuant to a third-party power purchase agreement or distributed electric generation lease agreement is not a public service corporation.

Establishes a moratorium, effective Green New Deal Act. Establishes a moratorium, effective January 1, 2022, on approval by any state agency or political subdivision of any approval required for (i) electric generating facilities that generate fossil fuel energy through the combustion of a fossil fuel resource; (ii) import or export terminals for fossil fuel resources; (iii) certain maintenance activities relating to an import or export terminal for a fossil fuel resource; (iv) gathering lines or pipelines for the transport of any fossil fuel resource that  require the use of eminent domain on private property; (v) certain maintenance activities relating to such gathering lines or pipelines; (vi) refineries of a fossil fuel resource; and (vii) exploration for any type of fossil fuel, unless preempted by applicable federal law. The measure also requires that at least 80 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier in calendar years 2028 through 2035 be generated from clean energy resources. In calendar year 2036 and every calendar year thereafter, 100 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier is required to be generated from clean energy resources. The clean energy mandates apply to a public utility or other person that sells not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy to retail customers or generates not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy for use by the person. The Director of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy is authorized to bring actions for injunctions to enforce these requirements. The measure requires the Department to adopt a Climate Action Plan that addresses all aspects of climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, resiliency, and assistance in the transition from current energy sources to clean renewable energy. The measure provides that any retail electric supplier that fails to meet any goal or benchmark is liable for a civil penalty equal to twice the cost of the financial investment necessary to meet such goal or mandate that was not achieved, or three times the cost of the financial investment necessary to meet such goal or benchmark that was not achieved if not met in an environmental justice community. The measure provides that it is the goal of the Commonwealth to achieve a 36 percent reduction in electric energy consumption in buildings by 2036. The measure requires the Department, in coordination with the Virginia Council on Environmental Justice (Council) to establish performance benchmarks for environmental justice communities and to establish programs for jobs for people in environmental justice communities. The measure requires the Council to develop and make available to each state agency training modules designed to facilitate the promotion of environmental justice. The measure requires the Department to establish the Transitioning Workers Program (the Program) to provide support for workers in the fossil fuel industry and affected communities and provide such workers job training, relocation support, income and benefit support, and early retirement benefits. The measure provides for funding such program by 20 percent of the revenue generated by the allowance auction established by the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality. The measure prohibits the Commission from approving construction of any new utility-owned generating facilities that emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of combusting fuel to generate electricity. The measure requires that all utility costs associated with the construction of, acquisition of, or agreements to purchase the energy, capacity, and environmental attributes of certain required generation and storage facilities are recovered through the utility's rates for generation and distribution services. The measure requires that under the renewable energy portfolio standard program, Dominion Energy Virginia and American Electric Power be required to produce their electricity from 80 percent renewable sources by 2028 and 100 percent by 2036. The measure increases the incremental energy efficiency savings that each investor-owned incumbent electric utility is required to achieve that start in 2022 at 2.4 percent for American Electric Power and Dominion Energy Virginia of the average annual energy retail sales by that utility in 2020 and increases those savings annually."}, "445": {"bill_id": 1398777, "number": "HB1938", "change_hash": "f25f6386d58f7dfdf69f250c84fcdd70", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB1938/2021", "status_date": "2021-01-11", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2021-02-05", "last_action": "Left in Courts of Justice", "title": "Firefighting, emerg. medical services, or law-enforcement equipment & vehicles; destroying, penalty.", "description": "Destroying or tampering with firefighting or emergency medical services equipment or law-enforcement equipment and vehicles; penalty.

Under current law, a landlord may accept full or partial payment of all rent and receive an order of possession pursuant to an unlawful detainer action and proceed with eviction, provided that he has stated in a written notice to the tenant that any and all amounts owed to the landlord by the tenant, including payment of any rent, damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs, would be accepted with reservation and would not constitute a waiver of the landlord's right to evict the tenant from the dwelling unit. The bill provides specific language that must be included within such notice, and requires a landlord who elects to seek possession of the dwelling unit to provide a copy of the notice to the court for service to the tenant along with the summons for unlawful detainer. The bill also allows tenants to exercise the right of redemption in unlawful detainer actions an unlimited number of times. Under current law, tenants may only exercise the right of redemption once during any 12-month period of continuous residency in the dwelling unit, regardless of the term of the rental agreement or any renewal term of the rental agreement. The bill directs the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development (Director) to develop a sample termination notice to be maintained on the Department of Housing and Community Development's (Department) website that includes language referencing acceptance of rent with reservation by a landlord following a breach of a lease by a tenant, and requires the Department to convene a stakeholder group to provide input to the Director regarding the development of such sample termination notice."}, "522": {"bill_id": 1402848, "number": "HB2015", "change_hash": "ae21409bdfee60db60e51a288de27b99", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB2015/2021", "status_date": "2021-01-12", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2021-02-01", "last_action": "Passed by indefinitely in Appropriations (21-Y 0-N)", "title": "Essential workers; hazard pay, employer to provide personal protective equipment, civil penalty.", "description": "Essential workers; hazard pay; personal protective equipment; civil penalty.

The bill provides that no waiver of the absentee ballot envelope witness signature shall be permitted under any circumstances and requires absentee ballots to have, in addition to the witness signature, the witness's printed name and residence address. The bill also requires certain actions to be taken to process absentee ballots that are returned by mail before election day. The general registrar is required to examine the ballot envelopes to verify completion of the required voter affirmation; mark the pollbook, or the absentee voter applicant list if the pollbook is not available, that the voter has voted; and open the sealed ballot envelopes and insert the ballots in optical scan counting equipment or other secure ballot container without initiating any ballot count totals.
