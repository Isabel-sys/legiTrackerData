The bill provides that, in lieu of the triennial review proceedings required under current law, Dominion Energy Virginia, beginning in 2023, will be subject to biennial reviews of their rates, terms, and conditions for generation, distribution, and transmission services. The bill requires that if, during a biennial review filed on or before December 31, 2023, the Commission determines that the utility has earned more than 70 basis points above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills. For a biennial review filed after December 31, 2023, the bill requires that if the Commission determines that the utility has earned above its fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services, the Commission will direct that 85 percent of the amount of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills and that all of any such overearnings that were more than 150 basis points above the utility's fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution services be credited to customers' bills. The bill requires that the Commission, in determining a fair rate of return on common equity for an investor-owned electric utility in any biennial review initiated prior to December 31, 2023, set such rate at 9.70 percent, which is based on the simple average of the authorized returns for vertically integrated electric utilities by the applicable regulatory commissions in the peer group jurisdictions of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. The bill provides that for any review after December 31, 2023, the Commission may use any methodology to determine such return it finds consistent with the public interest.
