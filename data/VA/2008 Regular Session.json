Cigarette packages are required to be marked so that compliant cigarettes may be distinguished from those not certified as compliant. The specific mark is determined by the manufacturer, subject to Commissioner approval. This measure provides that cigarettes compliant with similar New York regulations will be compliant with these requirements and that manufacturers may use the same package markings they use in that state. The requirements do not apply to cigarettes sold in North Carolina or South Carolina, or packaged for sale outside the United States. Manufacturers are assessed a fee of $250 per brand, the proceeds from which are divided between the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the State Fire Marshal. Violators are subject to civil penalties. Fees assessed on manufacturers and civil penalties collected from violators are deposited in a Cigarette Fire Safety Standard and Firefighter Protection Act Fund, to be split between implementation of this measure and use by the State Fire Marshal in carrying out the Statewide Fire Prevention Code. The measure will become effective 13 months after its enactment, and will expire on the effective date of any federal reduced cigarette ignition propensity standard that preempts the measure."}, "228": {"bill_id": 22536, "number": "HB229", "change_hash": "3233aa2085e41dee384eb75abf542508", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB229/2008", "status_date": "2008-03-08", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2008-03-14", "last_action": "Governor: Acts of Assembly Chapter text (CHAP0467)", "title": "Veterans services; Dept. to establish guidelines for eligibility for domiciled veterans, etc.", "description": "Veterans services in the Commonwealth.

Subtitle II establishes the various commodity-related boards, councils, and foundations formed to promote the agricultural industry in the Commonwealth. It begins with a listing of the special funds associated with these various collegial bodies and the reporting requirements for commodity boards, then sets out all of the commodity boards and prescribes their powers and duties. Subtitle III provides for the production and sale of agricultural products through a system of grading, licensing, certification, and registration.
