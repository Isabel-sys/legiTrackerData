Directs the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) to adopt regulations establishing fee schedules setting the maximum pecuniary liability of the employer for medical services provided to an injured person pursuant to the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, in the absence of a contract under which the provider has agreed to accept a specified amount for the medical service. The regulations implementing the fee schedules shall become effective on January 1, 2018. The initial fee schedules will set amounts based on a reimbursement objective, which is the average of all amounts paid to providers in the same category of providers for the medical service in the same medical community. The Commission is required to retain a firm to assist it in establishing the initial fee schedules. The firm will recommend a methodology that will provide statistically valid estimates of the reimbursement objective for fee scheduled medical services within the medical communities. Reimbursements for medical services provided to treat traumatic injuries and serious burns are excluded from the fee schedules and liability for their treatment costs will be based, absent a contract, on 80 percent of the provider's charges. However, the required reimbursement will be 100 percent of the provider's charges if the employer unsuccessfully contests the compensability of the claim. The Commission is required to review and revise the fee schedules in the year after they become effective and biennially thereafter. The liability of the employer for certain medical services not included in a fee schedule will be set by the Commission. A stop-loss feature allows hospitals to receive payments or reimbursements that exceed the fee schedule amount for certain claims when the total charges exceed a charge outlier threshold, which initially is 150 percent of the maximum fee for the service set forth in the applicable fee schedule. Providers are prohibited from using a different charge master or schedule of fees for any medical service provided for workers' compensation patients than the provider uses for health care services provided to patients who are not claimants. The measure requires the Commission, when determining whether the employee's attorney's work with regard to a contested claim resulted in an award of benefits that inure to the benefit of a third-party insurance carrier or health care provider, and in determining the reasonableness of the amount of any fee awarded to an attorney, to consider only the amount paid by the employer or insurance carrier to the third-party insurance carrier or health care provider for medical services rendered to the employee through a certain date and not to consider additional amounts previously paid to a health care provider or reimbursed to a third-party insurance carrier. The Commission shall have an independent, peer-reviewed study conducted every two years.

Makes several changes to the current method used by multistate corporations to apportion income to Virginia for purposes of the corporate income tax, including (i) establishing sales as the sole factor to be used in apportioning income, with such single sales factor apportionment phased in and first effective beginning with taxable year 2019; (ii) adopting market-based sourcing as the approach for sourcing sales of services and nontangible personal property to Virginia; and (iii) eliminating the requirements placed on manufacturing companies electing single sales factor apportionment to maintain certain employment and wage levels. In general, current law requires multistate corporations to apportion taxable income to Virginia using a double-weighted sales factor formula, which consists of a sales factor that is double-weighted, a property factor, and a payroll factor to apportion the income. Under single sales factor apportionment, only the sales factor will be used by a multistate corporation to apportion taxable income to Virginia. Under the bill, most multistate corporations will be required to use single sales factor apportionment beginning with taxable year 2019, with manufacturing companies being one exception as discussed below.  Currently, manufacturing companies are allowed to elect single sales factor apportionment in lieu of double-weighted sales factor apportionment. However, manufacturing companies electing single sales factor apportionment must meet certain employment and wage levels for the first three taxable years in which single sales factor apportionment is used. A monetary penalty is imposed upon any manufacturing company that has elected to apportion income using a single sales factor but that fails to meet the employment and wage level requirements. Under the bill, manufacturing companies may adopt single sales factor apportionment or continue to use double-weighted sales factor apportionment. The bill provides that a manufacturing company that adopts singles sales factor apportionment in a taxable year beginning on or after July 1, 2016, will not be subject to any monetary penalty but may not revoke the election to use single sales factor apportionment. The bill implements market-based sourcing for attributing sales to Virginia other than sales of tangible personal property beginning with taxable year 2017. The bill provides that sales made by certain communications services or Internet access services providers, other than sales of tangible personal property, that are attributable to Virginia under market-based sourcing will be multiplied by a factor of 0.5 for purposes of computing such companies' sales factors. The multiplication factor of 0.5 will be applied to such sales if the provider, or an affiliated group that includes a communications services or Internet access services provider, during the taxable year expended at least $100 million relating to communications services or Internet access services in the form of tangible personal property placed in service in Virginia or salaries and wages paid for its employees in Virginia. In addition, the bill provides that certain sales of national defense contractors will be excluded from such contractors' sales factor under market-based sourcing. Sales of a national defense contractor other than sales of tangible personal property that are attributable to a federal defense acquisition contract for a sale other than a sale of tangible personal property will be excluded if (a) a greater proportion of the income producing activity is performed outside Virginia, based on costs of performance; (b) the laws of another state require that the sale be included in the numerator of the fraction used in apportioning the contractor's income to that state for income tax purposes; and (c) the laws of such other state require that the sale be included in such numerator only if the greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in that state, based on costs of performance. With the exception of the elimination of the employment and wage level requirements placed on manufacturing companies electing single sales factor apportionment that becomes effectives for taxable years beginning on or after July 1, 2016, all other provisions in the bill will become effective only if the bill's provisions are not estimated by the Department of Taxation to reduce the official forecasted general fund revenues by more than $50 million for any fiscal year. The bill requires the Department to prepare a fiscal impact statement on general fund revenues from implementation of the bill. The fiscal impact statement is required to be provided to the Governor and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Finance, and Senate Committee on Finance by December 1, 2016. To facilitate the Department's preparation of the fiscal impact statement, every corporation having income from business activity that is taxable both within and without Virginia and that had Virginia taxable income before apportionment of at least $50 million for taxable year 2014 will be required to recalculate its 2014 sales factor using market-based sourcing. The bill requires that the recalculated sales factor be submitted to the Department by July 1, 2016, and imposes a $5,000 penalty for the failure to do so. The bill requires the Tax Commissioner by September 1 of each year beginning in 2018 to make a written certification to the Governor and the General Assembly reporting any net additional revenues attributable to the bill's provisions, if any, that were received in the state treasury for the immediately prior fiscal year. The next regular session of the General Assembly would be required to provide an amount of tax relief that at least equal to the amount certified by the Tax Commissioner."}, "966": {"bill_id": 812970, "number": "HB967", "change_hash": "96b07a79d665c2108ede517e9060d2e6", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB967/2016", "status_date": "2016-01-12", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-02-03", "last_action": "Stricken from docket by Education by voice vote", "title": "School term; waiver of length of school term, early course mastery.", "description": "Length of the school term; waiver; early course mastery.

Directs the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) to adopt regulations establishing fee schedules setting the maximum pecuniary liability of the employer for medical services provided to an injured person pursuant to the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, in the absence of a contract under which the provider has agreed to accept a specified amount for the medical service. The regulations implementing the fee schedules shall become effective on January 1, 2018. The initial fee schedules will set amounts based on a reimbursement objective, which is the average of all amounts paid to providers in the same category of providers for the medical service in the same medical community. The Commission is required to retain a firm to assist it in establishing the initial fee schedules. The firm will recommend a methodology that will provide statistically valid estimates of the reimbursement objective for fee-scheduled medical services within the medical communities. Reimbursements for medical services provided to treat traumatic injuries and serious burns are excluded from the fee schedules and liability for their treatment costs will be based, absent a contract, on 80 percent of the provider's charges. However, the required reimbursement will be 100 percent of the provider's charges if the employer unsuccessfully contests the compensability of the claim. The Commission is required to review and revise the fee schedules in the year after they become effective and biennially thereafter. The liability of the employer for certain medical services not included in a fee schedule will be set by the Commission. A stop-loss feature allows hospitals to receive payments or reimbursements that exceed the fee schedule amount for certain claims when the total charges exceed a charge outlier threshold, which initially is 150 percent of the maximum fee for the service set forth in the applicable fee schedule. Providers are prohibited from using a different charge master or schedule of fees for any medical service provided for workers' compensation patients than the provider uses for health care services provided to patients who are not claimants. The measure requires the Commission, when determining whether the employee's attorney's work with regard to a contested claim resulted in an award of benefits that inure to the benefit of a third-party insurance carrier or health care provider, and in determining the reasonableness of the amount of any fee awarded to an attorney, to consider only the amount paid by the employer or insurance carrier to the third-party insurance carrier or health care provider for medical services rendered to the employee through a certain date and not to consider additional amounts previously paid to a health care provider or reimbursed to a third-party insurance carrier.

The measure requires the hearing to be held within 60 days from the date of filing of the application unless additional time is specifically requested.
