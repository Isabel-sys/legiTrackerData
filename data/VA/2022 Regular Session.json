Establishes a moratorium, effective January 1, 2023, on approval by any state agency or political subdivision of any approval required for (i) electric generating facilities that generate fossil fuel energy through the combustion of a fossil fuel resource; (ii) import or export terminals for fossil fuel resources; (iii) certain maintenance activities relating to an import or export terminal for a fossil fuel resource; (iv) gathering lines or pipelines for the transport of any fossil fuel resource that require the use of eminent domain on private property; (v) certain maintenance activities relating to such gathering lines or pipelines; (vi) refineries of a fossil fuel resource; and (vii) exploration for any type of fossil fuel, unless preempted by applicable federal law. The measure also requires that at least 80 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier in calendar years 2030 through 2034 be generated from clean energy resources. In calendar year 2035 and every calendar year thereafter, 100 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier is required to be generated from clean energy resources. The clean energy mandates apply to a public utility or other person that sells not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy to retail customers or generates not less than 1,000 megawatt hours of electric energy for use by the person. The Director of the Department of Energy (the Department) is authorized to bring actions for injunctions to enforce these requirements. The measure requires the Department to adopt a Climate Action Plan that addresses all aspects of climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, resiliency, and assistance in the transition from current energy sources to clean renewable energy. The measure provides that any retail electric supplier that fails to meet any goal or benchmark is liable for a civil penalty equal to twice the cost of the financial investment necessary to meet such goal or mandate that was not achieved, or three times the cost of the financial investment necessary to meet such goal or benchmark that was not achieved if not met in an environmental justice community. The measure further states that the Department shall appoint and convene a state Environmental and Climate Justice Task Force (the Task Force) to provide recommendations about the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The measure provides that it is the goal of the Commonwealth to achieve a 36 percent reduction in electric energy consumption in buildings by 2036. The measure requires the Department, in coordination with the Virginia Council on Environmental Justice (the Council) to establish performance benchmarks for environmental justice communities and to establish programs for jobs for people in environmental justice communities. The measure requires the Council to develop and make available to each state agency training modules designed to facilitate the promotion of environmental justice. The measure requires the Department to establish the Just Transition Fund (the Fund) to be used for state programs, grants and loans, job training and placement programs that support renewable and clean energy development and energy efficiency, and for funding the Transitioning Workers Program, which provides support for workers in the fossil fuel industry and affected communities and provides such workers with job training, relocation support, income and benefit support, and early retirement benefits. The measure prohibits the State Corporation Commission from approving construction of any new utility-owned generating facilities that emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of combusting fuel to generate electricity. The measure requires that all utility costs associated with the construction of, acquisition of, or agreements to purchase the energy, capacity, and environmental attributes of certain required generation and storage facilities be recovered through the utility's rates for generation and distribution services. The measure requires that under the renewable energy portfolio standard program, Dominion Energy Virginia and American Electric Power be required to produce their electricity from 80 percent renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035. The measure increases the incremental energy efficiency savings that each investor-owned incumbent electric utility is required to achieve that start in 2023 at 2.4 percent for American Electric Power and Dominion Energy Virginia of the average annual energy retail sales by that utility in 2021 and increases those savings annually."}, "469": {"bill_id": 1551684, "number": "HB470", "change_hash": "b542222912d3fe6c324e36f004269029", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB470/2022", "status_date": "2022-04-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2022-04-01", "last_action": "Governor: Acts of Assembly Chapter text (CHAP0065)", "title": "Common interest communities; prohibition on refusal to recognize a licensed real estate broker.", "description": "Common interest communities; prohibition on refusal to recognize a licensed real estate broker.

Provides that a licensed insurer may issue a policy of group accident and sickness insurance to an association of real estate salespersons (association), which association shall be deemed the policyholder, and that such association health plan is not considered to be insurance and is not subject to the existing requirements for insurance if certain requirements are met. The bill requires that (i) all members of the association be eligible for coverage and membership, including employer members with at least one employee that is domiciled in the Commonwealth or self-employed individuals; (ii) membership in the association not be conditioned on any health status\u2013related factor; (iii) the coverage offered through the association be available to all members regardless of any health status\u2013related factor; (iv) the association not make health insurance coverage offered through the association available other than in connection with a member of the association; and (v) premiums for the policy be paid from funds contributed by the association or associations, or by employer members, or by both, or from funds contributed by the covered persons or from both the covered persons and the association, associations, or employer members.

Finally, the bill provides that a policy that meets certain requirements of the bill is considered to be compliant with the large group market insurance regulations under the federal Public Health Service Act and, as such, the Commonwealth is considered to be substantially enforcing the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with regard to such policy. The bill requires the State Corporation Commission to regulate the policy in a manner that is consistent with such provisions. The bill provides that, in any case in which a federal agency renders a decision that is contrary to such provisions, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General may resolve any difference between federal law and the laws of the Commonwealth."}, "768": {"bill_id": 1553076, "number": "HB769", "change_hash": "028158898f519ca60a6d9e6e4d708a7c", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB769/2022", "status_date": "2022-04-11", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2022-04-11", "last_action": "Governor: Acts of Assembly Chapter text (CHAP0486)", "title": "Onsite sewage system pump-out oversight; certain localities.", "description": "Department of Health; onsite sewage system pump-out oversight; certain localities.

Beginning with taxable year 2022, individual income tax brackets, the filing threshold, the amount of the standard deduction, and the amount of personal exemptions shall be adjusted on an annual basis in accordance with the yearly change in the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U). The bill imposes the retail sales and use tax on digital personal property, defined in the bill as a digital product delivered electronically that the purchaser owns or has the ability to continually access without having to pay an additional subscription or usage fee to the seller after paying the initial purchase price. The bill also applies the retail sales and use tax to the following services: admissions; charges for recreation, fitness, or sports facilities; nonmedical personal services or counseling; dry cleaning and laundry services; companion animal care; residential home repair or maintenance, landscaping, or cleaning services when paid for directly by a resident or homeowner; vehicle and engine repair; repairs or alterations to tangible personal property; storage of tangible personal property; delivery or shipping services; travel, event, and aesthetic planning services; and communications services that are not subject to the communications sales and use tax and are not digital personal property.  Certain exemptions are provided to the sales and use tax on services, including health care services that must be performed by a person licensed or certified by the Department of Health Professions, veterinary services, professional services, Internet access services, and services provided by a person who does not receive more than $2,500 per year in gross receipts for performance of such services. The bill exempts services purchased by a nonprofit organization and services purchased by a homeowners' association or by a landlord for the benefit of his tenant. The bill also repeals the service exemptions currently provided for the sale of custom programs and modification of prewritten programs. The bill imposes the communications sales and use tax on prepaid calling services and on digital subscription services, defined in the bill as services for which the user pays in order to access and use software, reading materials, or other digital data or applications for a defined period of time, which products the user does not own or have permanent access to outside of such period of time. The bill provides that a portion of the income tax credit for low-income taxpayers who are residents of the Commonwealth shall be refundable. Under current law, eligible taxpayers may claim either (i) a nonrefundable income tax credit equal to $300 for each individual, his spouse, and any dependents or (ii) an income tax credit equal to 20 percent of the federal earned income tax credit. For taxpayers claiming the credit referenced in clause (ii), 50 percent of the value of the credit would be refundable in taxable year 2021, and the refundable portion would increase by five percent each year, becoming fully refundable starting in taxable year 2031. Nonresident taxpayers and resident taxpayers claiming the credit referenced in clause (i) shall not be eligible for a refundable credit. The bill also exempts food purchased for human consumption and essential personal hygiene products (the grocery tax) from all state and regional sales taxes and that, beginning July 1, 2022, food purchased for human consumption and essential personal hygiene products are also exempt from the local sales tax, and the grocery tax is eliminated."}, "1343": {"bill_id": 1568335, "number": "HB1344", "change_hash": "f1e745c826f189a067d310df5c73c44e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/HB1344/2022", "status_date": "2022-02-14", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2022-03-01", "last_action": "Passed by indefinitely in Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources (10-Y 5-N)", "title": "Hunters, certain; right to go on lands of another.", "description": "Right of certain hunters to go on lands of another.
