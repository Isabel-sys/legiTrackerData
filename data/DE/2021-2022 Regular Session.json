The nonforfeiture amount is the deferred annuitys accumulated value, minus certain charges (such as prior withdrawals and loans), based on interest rate minimums regulated by statute. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market interest rates have fallen so low as to render unrealistic the old statutory rates that insurance companies were required to use in determining the amount to return to contract holders.

The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for engineers. It develops, administers, and scores the examinations used for engineering licensure in the United States. Most recently, NCEES has recommended that states broaden access to licensure subject to rigorous competency requirements. For example, Delaware has historically recognized EAC of ABET-accredited (Engineering Accreditation Commission of the former Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) programs as the gold standard for engineering education. NCEES has recommended that graduates of engineering programs accredited by signatories of the Washington Accord be afforded the same recognition as EAC of ABET graduates. The Washington Accord is an international agreement between bodies responsible for accrediting engineering degree programs. Signatories of the Accord mutually recognize the substantial equivalency of participating organizations accreditation processes and their graduates preparedness to begin professional practice at the entry level. ABET and Engineers Canada are signatories of the Accord among a total of 20 representing agencies from every continent. This Act will give holders of degrees from engineering programs accredited by Washington Accord signatories the same recognition as EAC of ABET graduates. The required engineering experience for such applicants will be four years. This Act also proposes modifications that would expand licensure comity. While many professions in Delaware use the term reciprocity to define the process whereby an individual licensed in one jurisdiction may become licensed in Delaware, the term comity is used in the licensing law for professional engineers. To promote international engineering licensure mobility, this Act provides that the Council may license an applicant who is an International Professional Engineer (IntPE), meaning that the applicant has been fully and rigorously evaluated and approved by the International Engineering Alliance (IEA). NCEES is a member of the IEA and the International Professional Engineers Agreement (IPEA). There are currently 15 other members of the IPEA including Engineers Canada. The International Professional Engineers Agreement recognizes the substantial equivalency of standards establishing the competency of professional engineers for independent practice. Engineers who are licensed by agencies that are members of IPEA undergo a rigorous application process for registration as IntPEs. NCEES is an IPEA member and maintains a registry of U.S. licensed engineers who have attained IntPE status. Engineers registered as IntPEs would be provided with the same eligibility for comity within the U.S. as would U.S. state-licensed engineers. This applicant will also need to present proof of five years of experience obtained after initial licensure. This Act further proposes that an applicant who has been designated as a Model Law Engineer by NCEES may be issued a license administratively on the basis that the applicant has already been vetted by the professions governing body. Other provisions pertaining to comity have been amended to make the Practice Act consistent with other statutes governing professional licensure. Specifically, the comity provision pertaining to licensure by experience has been revised to require five years of licensed experience rather than the current ten years. The standards for licensure by comity have been amended to ensure that the applicant has a current license in good standing from the originating jurisdiction. This Act clarifies the grounds for denial of an application to explicitly include discipline in another jurisdiction. This Act eliminates the requirement that licensees must acquire an embossing seal and allows them to choose a seal format, such as embossing, stamp or electronic. Finally, this Act strikes references to permits on the basis that compliance with temporary permit requirements is difficult for the Council to monitor. Further, as an alternative to the temporary permit, an expedited path to licensure will be available for applicants with the Model Law Engineer designation."}, "143": {"bill_id": 1490557, "number": "HB144", "change_hash": "a9bd5c44fcf779f86ba3909ad7746667", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB144/2021", "status_date": "2022-01-19", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2022-03-10", "last_action": "Assigned to Appropriations Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Funding For Prekindergarten Special Education.", "description": "This Act increases funding for preschool children with disabilities who are not counted in either intensive or complex special education units by revising the current ratio of 12.8 students per unit to 8.4 students per unit for children 3 years of age and older enrolled in a preschool program.

This Act clarifies that a speech/language pathologist applicant must present a certificate of clinical competence issued by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).

The distinction is that ASHA evaluates the speech/language pathologists practicum and clinical fellowship, which are requirements for licensure.

This Act sets forth requirements for licensure of applicants who were educated outside of the United States. This Act states that a hearing aid applicant may be supervised by either an audiologist or hearing aid dispenser during the training period.

However, Delawares current process of redistricting is deeply flawed. It allows the majority party in each legislative chamber to gerrymander state legislative maps in a self-serving attempt to preserve and expand partisan political power. All other considerations have become secondary in this process. This defect is common to many states and some have tried to address the issue by creating election commissions charged with redrawing legislative lines. The challenge in such a system is ensuring that these commissions can conduct their function in a balanced, objective, and non-partisan fashion. This bill proposes a new method that avoids this significant hurdle by leveraging partisan self-interest to create a protocol that results in an equitable outcome. This fresh approach to reapportionment is described in a paper by 3 Carnegie Mellon University professors entitled: A Partisan Districting Protocol with Provably Nonpartisan Outcomes. It utilizes a system analogous to a proven, prudent method for instructing 2 children to fairly divide a piece of cake between themselves. The first child cuts the cake, while the second has the option of selecting which piece he or she wishes to consume. In the protocol outlined in this bill, the two competing parties are the partisan caucuses of each General Assembly chamber. The first caucus will initially draw all the legislative districts, observing established legal redistricting standards. The second caucus will have the ability to freeze a set number of the districts, locking their boundaries into place. They will then be able to redraw the remaining districts as they wish, delivering the new maps back to the first caucus. This group will then also engage in the freeze and redraw process, with the cycles continuing until all the districts have been defined. With both sides getting equal bites of the apple, each has a practical ability to affect the outcome and a reason to work together to achieve a mutually acceptable conclusion. The bill also includes safeguards to ensure public notification and participation in the process, as well as a contingency to allow the judicial branch to draw the new legislative maps should the General Assembly be unable to achieve the task. This legislation assumes calling the General Assembly into special session to approve the finalized maps, providing enough time for the process to be conducted in a deliberative manner."}, "236": {"bill_id": 1515243, "number": "HB237", "change_hash": "bd630dc73ce1b040df5fadd0fda06c10", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB237/2021", "status_date": "2021-09-10", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2021-09-10", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 19 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Police Officers And Firefighters Employment Relations Act.", "description": "Currently, there are police officers in this State that are not covered by the Police Officers and Firefighters Employment Relations Act meaning that they do not possess the right of organization and representation.

The term inclusive requires states to extend eligibility until a students 22nd birthday. The IDEA allows states to limit the age of eligibility for FAPE to students between the ages of 18 through 21 only to the extent state law, practice, or court order limits the provision of public education to all children within those age ranges. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(B). In Delaware, state law and practice provide public education to adults without age limitation. Delaware is one of the few states that has developed a public adult high school, the James H. Groves Adult High School, accommodating those needing an alternative to a regular day-school program. As such, federal law requires Delaware to extend eligibility for children with disabilities through their 22nd birthday. Current statute and regulation extend eligibility to the end of the school year in which a child with a disability turns 21, this Act proposes to keep the established exit point to minimize service interruptions and only change the age from the end of the school year in which a child turns 21 to the end of the school year in which a child turns 22."}, "452": {"bill_id": 1623661, "number": "HB455", "change_hash": "d784a04a30a122a67427ce5fa9509669", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB455/2021", "status_date": "2022-06-29", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2022-06-29", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 24, 10, 11, And 18 Relating To The Womens Reproductive Health.", "description": "Section 1 and 2.

This clarification is necessary in light of certain members of the bail industrys attempts to circumvent the requirements of HB 151, as reflected in the Superior Court opinion issued in the matter of Preferred Financial Services, Inc. v. A&amp;R Bail Bonds LLC, et al., 2019 WL 315331 (Del. Super. January 23, 2019), affd 2019 WL 4042324 (Del. August 28, 2019). The bill also creates a standard term (bail agent business entity) to refer to business entities that advertise and act as bail agents and standardizes the use of the phrase throughout the subchapter. Section 2 provides a definition of financial interest and revises the provision regarding background check requirements to permit applicants to submit federal background check requests electronically through SBI. Section 3 of this bill clarifies that the duties of bail agents as set forth in Section 4333B(b) apply both to individual property bail agents and business entity licensees and also grants the Commissioner the authority to request from licensees financial statements and balance sheets in a form required by the Commissioner, bank statements, and other information deemed necessary by the Commissioner in her review of the business operations of licensees under this Chapter. Section 4 of this bill requires the automatic suspension of a bail entitys license if such entitys designated responsible individual licensee is no longer in good standing and dictates that a designated responsible individual licensee is responsible for the business entitys failure to comply with the relevant insurance laws. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill correct a typographical error in the original statute. Section 6 of this bill increases the amount of the bond that bail agents are required to file with the Department. Section 7 also sets forth the procedure for requesting a hearing in connection with a license application denial, which is consistent with the procedures set forth in Chapter 17 of the Insurance Code for producers. Section 8 of this bill includes additional record maintenance requirements in connection with the use of bail funders. Sections 9 and 10 make changes for technical and consistency purposes. Section 11 of this bill requires bail agents to substantively respond to Department inquiries within a reasonable timeframe, which is consistent with the requirements under Title 18s Unfair Trade Practices Act (Ch. 23).
