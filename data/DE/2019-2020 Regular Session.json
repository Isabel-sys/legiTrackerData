However, Delawares current process of redistricting is deeply flawed. It allows the majority party in each legislative chamber to gerrymander state legislative maps in a self-serving attempt to preserve and expand partisan political power. All other considerations have become secondary in this process. This defect is common to many states and some have tried to address the issue by creating election commissions charged with redrawing legislative lines. The challenge in such a system is ensuring that these commissions can conduct their function in a balanced, objective, and non-partisan fashion. This bill proposes a new method that avoids this significant hurdle by leveraging partisan self-interest to create a protocol that results in an equitable outcome. This fresh approach to reapportionment is described in a paper by 3 Carnegie Mellon University professors entitled: A Partisan Districting Protocol with Provably Nonpartisan Outcomes. It utilizes a system analogous to a proven, prudent method for instructing 2 children to fairly divide a piece of cake between themselves. The first child cuts the cake, while the second has the option of selecting which piece he or she wishes to consume. In the protocol outlined in this bill, the two competing parties are the partisan caucuses of each General Assembly chamber. The first caucus will initially draw all the legislative districts, observing established legal redistricting standards. The second caucus will have the ability to freeze a set number of the districts, locking their boundaries into place. They will then be able to redraw the remaining districts as they wish, delivering the new maps back to the first caucus. This group will then also engage in the freeze and redraw process, with the cycles continuing until all the districts have been defined. With both sides getting equal bites of the apple, each has a practical ability to affect the outcome and a reason to work together to achieve a mutually acceptable conclusion. The bill also includes safeguards to ensure public notification and participation in the process, as well as a contingency to allow the judicial branch to draw the new legislative maps should the General Assembly be unable to achieve the task. This legislation assumes calling the General Assembly into special session to approve the finalized maps, providing enough time for the process to be conducted in a deliberative manner."}, "308": {"bill_id": 1359598, "number": "HB311", "change_hash": "472fb445fdeba022e9cff9171f9ac40f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB311/2019", "status_date": "2020-03-12", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2020-03-12", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to Transportation/Land Use and Infrastructure Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Drivers License Issuance Fees, Renewals, And Qualifications.", "description": "This bill extends the amount of years an identification card is valid from four (4) to eight (8) years.

Currently the Division of Motor Vehicles will suspend or revoke a dealer license, and the dealer will get a family member or friend to apply for a dealership license and employ the suspended dealer at the dealership in a managerial, financial, or sales capacity thereby negating the suspension or revocation. This legislation closes that loophole by preventing a dealer who has had their license suspended, revoked, or renewal refused from being employed at Delaware licensed dealerships for periods of time commensurate with their revocation or suspension. Additionally, to prevent a further loophole wherein the dealer would simply turn in their dealer license upon receiving notice by the Division that their license will be revoked, suspended, or renewal refused, if the licensee chooses not to defend themselves they would be prohibited for the same time periods as if their license had been suspended, revoked, or renewal refused and be unable to do any of the qualifying employment for that period of suspension. This bill also extends the period of time of prohibited employment if the dealer does not turn in division documents and plates in its possession at the time of suspension or revocation.
