The revisions to Article 9 are part of a national effort led by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and The American Law Institute that seeks adoption of revisions in substantially the form proposed by all applicable states within, or other jurisdictions under the control of, the United States. Section 1: This amendment revises the definition of &#8220;authenticate&#8221; to more closely resemble the definition of &#8220;sign&#8221; in revised Uniform Commercial Code Articles 1 and 7, furthering the goals of electronic communication and medium-neutrality. Section 2: This amendment revises the definition of &#8220;certificate of title&#8221; to comport with the emerging practice of maintaining non-paper electronic records evidencing both ownership and security interests in certain property. Section 3 This amendment revised the definition of &#8220;jurisdiction of organization&#8221; so as to more clearly include within the definition of &#8220;registered organization&#8221; certain organizations that, under applicable law, are said to be &#8220;formed&#8221; rather than &#8220;organized.&#8221; Section 4 This amendment creates the new defined term &#8220;public organic record.&#8221; It provides greater clarity for determining both (i) whether a given organization is a registered organization, and (ii) if a registered organization, its name for filing purposes. Incidentally, it renumbers the sections following such new defined term. Additionally, it clarifies the defined term &#8220;registered organization.&#8221; Section 5: This amendment revises the prerequisites for &#8220;control&#8221; of electronic chattel paper. Section (a) derives from the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, and sets forth the general test for control. Subsection (b) sets forth a safe harbor test for control under the general test in Section (a). Section 6: This amendment reflects the approach taken by the 2010 Official Text to an imprecision relating to the location of certain registered organizations organized under federal law. Delaware anticipated and addressed this imprecision by non-uniform text in its initial enactment of Revised Article 9 (72 Del. Laws, c. 401). Though both Delaware&#8217;s original approach and this new approach intend the same result, the text of both appear in this Amendment for avoidance of any doubt. Section 7: This amendment replaces a reference in subsection (a)(3) of Section 9-311 to certificate of title statutes with a broader reference to statutes that provide for a security interest to be indicated on a certificate of title, thus capturing other statutes providing for such security interests. Sections 8 and 9: Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 9-316 address security interests that are perfected (i.e., that have attached and as to which any required perfection step has been taken) before the debtor changes location or there is a transfer of collateral to a new debtor. Prior to this amendment to Section 9-316, collateral to which a security interest attached following a change in location of the debtor or a transfer of collateral to a new debtor, was not perfected until the security interest was perfected according to the rules of the new jurisdiction. New subsection (h) addresses security interests that attach within four months after the debtor changes its location. Under subsection (h), a filed financing statement that would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the debtor had not changed its location is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired within four months after the relocation to another jurisdiction. Such security interest will remain perfected, if before the expiration of the four month period, the security interest is perfected under the laws of the other jurisdiction. Otherwise, the security interest will become unperfected at the end of the four month period and will be deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value. New subsection (i) is similar to subsection (h). Whereas subsection (h) addressed security interests that attach within four months after a debtor changes its location, subsection (i) addresses security interests that attach with four months after a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction. Subsection (i) also addresses collateral acquired by the new debtor before it becomes bound. Specifically, subsection (i) provides that following a transfer of collateral to a new debtor, the security interest of a secured party perfected prior to such transfer of collateral is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four month after, the new debtor became bound as debtor, upon attachment. It will remain perfected if, before the expiration of the four month period, the security interest is perfected under the laws of the other jurisdiction. Otherwise, the security interest will become unperfected at the end of the four-month period and will be deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser for value. Section 10: This amendment makes proper use of the terminology in Section 9-317(b) to describe a certificated security. Section 11: This amendment revises subsection (d) of Section 9-317 to clarify its applicability to all of the types of collateral in which a security interest cannot be perfected by possession. Section 12: The amendment revises the rule for subordination of security interests created by a new debtor to address the context arising under new subsection (i)(1) of Section 9-316. Sections 13 and 14: Subsection (e) of Section 9-406 and subsection (b) of Section 9-408 override certain contractual prohibitions on assignment of receivables. The former does not apply to sales of payment intangibles or promissory notes, while the latter does apply to security interests in payment intangibles and promissory notes where such security interests arise out of the sale of such property. Uncertainty has arisen as to whether a disposition of such collateral under Section 9-610 or an acceptance thereof under Section 9-620 is properly treated as a sale governed by Section 9-406 or a security interest governed by Section 9-408. This Amendment clarifies that such disposition is to be treated as a sale governed by Section 9-406, with the consequence that a buyer under Section 9-610 or an assignee under Section 9-620 can enforce those rights notwithstanding any contractual restriction. Sections 15 and 16: The amendments to Sections 9-502 and 9-503 are intended to clarify the manner in which various types of debtors are intended to be named or identified in financing statements. Section 16 offers greater specificity than current law in the case of registered organizations, and simplifies and clarifies in the cases of collateral administered by the personal representative of a decedent and collateral held in trust. With respect to debtors who are individuals, the amendments leave current law unchanged, and add a safe harbor for those providing correctly the debtor&#8217;s surname and first personal name only. Section 17: This amendment clarifies that it is the financing statement becoming seriously misleading and not the debtor&#8217;s name change that commences the four month period after which the security interest in any collateral acquired by the debtor is no longer perfected unless the financing statement is properly amended. Section 18: This amendment confirms and clarifies the application of Sections 9-507 and 9-508 in circumstances where a debtor has converted from one type of organization to another. When the laws governing the conversion provide that the post-conversion organization is the same organization as the pre-conversion organization, the converted organization does not constitute a new debtor for purposes of Section 9-508, though its name may have changed for purposes of Section 9-507(c). When the laws governing the conversion provide that the post-conversion organization is a different organization than the pre-conversion organization, the converted organization constitutes a new debtor for purposes of Section 9-508. Section 19: The amendment to subsection (f) of Section 9-515 clarifies that the designation of a debtor as a transmitting utility must be made in the initial financing statement in order for the financing statement to remain in effect indefinitely until a termination statement is filed. Sections 20-22: This amendment eliminates certain grounds upon which the filing office can reject financing statements. It also makes conforming changes to reflect the new nomenclature of &#8220;information statements&#8221; rather than &#8220;correction statements&#8221; and &#8220;surname&#8221; rather than &#8220;last name&#8221;. Also, prior to this amendment, Delaware had a non-uniform provision in subsection (e) that provided in situations where the debtor was a trust or a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust, certain information on a financing statement could be provided with respect to either the trust or the trustee. Changes were made to this non-uniform provision to conform the references to &#8220;collateral held in a trust&#8221; consistent with the related changes in Section 9-503 regarding the name of debtor provisions for &#8220;collateral held in a trust&#8221;. Section 23: This Amendment changes and clarifies the non-judicial means for indicating that a financing statement or other record was inaccurate or wrongfully filed. As before this Amendment took effect, the statement discussed in this Section is informational only, and has no legal effect. Reflecting this limitation, the statement is no longer denominated a &#8220;correction statement,&#8221; but instead an &#8220;information statement.&#8221; Where previously such statements could be filed only by debtors, they can now be filed by either debtors or secured parties of record. Sections 24 and 25: The amendments to Section 9-521 adopt new safe harbor forms of initial financing statements and financing statement amendments. In addition to adoption of the forms provided by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, Delaware has also adopted an alternative version of the form for financing statement amendments (Form UCC-3). Section 26: This amendment clarifies that the affidavit of the secured party required to enforce a mortgage non-judicially must state that default occurred with respect to the obligation secured by the mortgage. Section 27. This amendment revises the heading of Section 9-625(c) to reflect more accurately the text of such provision. Section 28: This amendment adds a new Part 8 providing for transition rules governing the implementation of the other parts of the amendments set forth above. Section 29: This Section makes a conforming amendment to Section 2A-103(2)."}, "8": {"bill_id": 453206, "number": "HB9", "change_hash": "efd10f57f376aec1b15268b3f76b3d7d", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB9/2013", "status_date": "2013-03-28", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-03-28", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Mental Health And Liability.", "description": "This legislation represents the work of the HJR 17 Study Group created to review Delaware&#8217;s civil mental health laws.

Unlike other states, this Act intends to put Delaware at the forefront of this important issue by not simply looking narrowly for mental illness. Statistically, mental illness has little to do with homicide perpetration but conversely increases the chance of being a victim of violence. This bill looks instead for propensities of violence, a much more reliable and evidence-based metric. This metric will also ensure that we can provide care to those more likely to commit violent acts and help destigmatize mental illness here in Delaware. Specific components of this Act are set forth below. This Act applies when a person who has been committed to a hospital for treatment of a mental condition by a judge shall be deemed a person prohibited. The current law appears to apply to &#8220;any person who has ever been committed for a mental disorder,&#8221; but in reality this only applies to persons who have been involuntarily committed and subject to adjudication such as a hearing. It also clarifies that perpetrators of violent crimes who have been found Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity, Guilty But Mentally Ill, or Mentally Incompetent to Stand Trial are persons prohibited, including juveniles who fall into those categories. The provisions of  1448B will not retroactively apply to any persons adjudicated in the past, which would create undue burden. This Act expands the definition of &#8220;persons prohibited&#8221; to include those persons who are prohibited from possessing firearms pursuant to a court order under the procedures set forth in  1448B of Title 11. Newly created  1448B sets forth a procedure whereby law enforcement, upon receiving a report of a violent person and who is demonstrating behaviors that the provider believes are dangerous can refer the matter to the Department of Justice to petition the Superior Court for an order requiring such person to relinquish the person&#8217;s firearms or ammunition. This Act revises and clarifies an existing statute, 11 Del C.  5402, which currently solidifies the need for mental health professionals to report those with mental illness who may be a threat to others. Currently, the section contains a limited duty of a treating hospital to warn law enforcement of a specific threat, but this clarifies the original intent of the section and requires that to avoid liability that all treating mental health professionals must report dangerous persons to law enforcement. The appropriate law enforcement agency must then determine whether a civil action should be initiated under newly created  1448B of this Title, to relinquish the person&#8217;s firearms or ammunition and to take appropriate investigative action. Pursuant to  1448B, the Court may order dangerous persons to relinquish to a law enforcement officer, voluntarily or otherwise, any firearms or ammunition owned, possessed, or controlled by such person. The Court may also, in its discretion, issue an order directing any law enforcement agency to forthwith search for and seize firearms and ammunition of any such person prohibited upon a showing of good cause by the petitioner. The court order to relinquish firearms would issue upon a finding that the person was prohibited, without further showing. The order authorizing police to search for and seize weapons would require a further showing, akin to an affidavit in support of a warrant, of &#8220;good cause&#8221; that the prohibited weapons would be found in a particular place or in the possession of the person prohibited. Any person subject to an order of the Court pursuant to  1448B may petition the Court for an order to return firearms or ammunition by establishing to a preponderance of evidence that he or she is not a danger to self or others. In addition, as is the case under the current law, any person who is adjudicated to be a person prohibited pursuant to this Act has the opportunity to demonstrate, pursuant to  1448A of Title 11, that he or she is no longer prohibited from possessing a firearm and therefore is no longer a person prohibited. ."}, "88": {"bill_id": 548464, "number": "HB89", "change_hash": "07a8803e9602c78aedb898cecc53613b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB89/2013", "status_date": "2013-06-25", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-06-25", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Health Planning And Resources Management.", "description": "This bill promotes and facilitates the construction and operation within the State of Delaware of freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, which generally are capable of providing services to victims of stroke, spinal cord injuries, amputation or other traumas.

Further, the bill seeks to eliminate discrimination by districts against choice students by: (1) allowing districts to request supplemental application information from choice students only to the extent it requires the same information from attendance zone students; (2) limiting the supplemental criteria a receiving district may use to evaluate choice applications&#8212;after that, districts must use a lottery system; and (3) removing the provision that allows districts to reject applications of students with special needs. Districts would also be required to accept choice students until each school and/or program has reached 85% of its capacity. Districts would be required to hold a public information session about choice and enrollment opportunities by October 31 and report estimated capacity and projected enrollment information to the Department of Education by November 30; those estimates may be revised until January 30. Finally, the bill will create a task force to consider the current landscape of all school enrollment preferences to include magnet, vocational technical, and charter schools, and to develop recommendations as necessary."}, "90": {"bill_id": 548904, "number": "HB91", "change_hash": "b2db5a88a12c7e9d280977656f338ac6", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB91/2013", "status_date": "2013-07-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-07-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 19 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Unemployment Compensation.", "description": "This Bill brings Delaware&#8217;s unemployment insurance law into compliance with federal law, Public Law 112-40, which requires that an employer&#8217;s unemployment insurance tax account cannot be relieved of charges for an unemployment insurance claim if the employer or the employer&#8217;s agent fails to provide the Department of Labor specified information in a timely manner or provides inadequate information for the Department to make a determination of eligibility and as a result, unemployment insurance benefits are erroneously paid to an individual."}, "91": {"bill_id": 548946, "number": "HB92", "change_hash": "09dbe8e1116a7c18ed0797af97172317", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB92/2013", "status_date": "2013-06-27", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-06-27", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 25 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Surety Bonds For Rental Property.", "description": "This bill amends the landlord/tenant code to permit the use of a surety bond in place of a security deposit.

This bill originates from a recommendation made by the 2003 Metachem Task Force, chaired by the Honorable William T. Quillen. As the Task Force Report noted, currently at least thirty-four states (including all of our neighboring states) and the federal government have statutory authority to impose environmental liens. Besides bringing Delaware law in line with the vast majority of our sister states and the United States, this Act provides an important means of protecting the public treasury while holding responsible property owners accountable for the environmental harm they cause. Section 1 of the Act provides DNREC with authority to impose an environmental lien when a violation of the Delaware Hazardous Substance Cleanup Act (HSCA) has resulted in the expenditure of State funds to protect human health and the environment. Specifically, if DNREC must perform a remedy at a property using public funds, it can impose an environmental lien in order to attempt to recover the State&#8217;s costs provided it gives prior notice to the property owner who has failed to perform or pay for the required remedial activities. An environmental lien when filed will have priority over subsequently filed liens. Such a lien will be discharged upon full satisfaction by the property owner of the liability for the remediation costs incurred by the State. A property owner who seeks to challenge the filing of an environmental lien can contest the imposition of the lien before the Environmental Appeals Board subject to the applicable statutory procedures contained in 7 Del. C. 6008. Additionally, if DNREC determines that the imposition of an environmental lien will be insufficient to enable it to recover its costs of performing a remedy in a particular case, it can petition the Delaware Court of Chancery to seek the imposition of an additional lien or liens on any other Delaware real property owned by the same person or persons as the property where the remediation activities occurred. Section 2 of the Act extends the same provisions applicable to a violation of HSCA to a violation of the Delaware Underground Storage Tank Act (7 Del. C. Chapter 74). As is the case with the other provisions of the Underground Storage Tank Act, certain agricultural, residential and non-commercial underground storage tanks are exempted from the provisions of this Act. Section 3 of the Act extends the same provisions applicable to a violation of HSCA and the Delaware Underground Storage Tank Act to the Jeffrey Davis Aboveground Storage Tank Act (7 Del. C. Chapter 74A). As is the case with the other provisions of the Aboveground Storage Tank Act, certain agricultural, residential and non-commercial aboveground storage tanks are exempted from the provisions of this Act. Section 4 of the Act provides that its provisions are severable."}, "95": {"bill_id": 548962, "number": "HB96", "change_hash": "6c0d84aea6f9751fa61d6a6105e73826", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB96/2013", "status_date": "2013-06-26", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-06-26", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 26 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Jurisdiction Of The Public Service Commission And Public Utiltiies Providing Telecommunication Services.", "description": "This bill amends sections of Title 26 which govern public utilities that provide telecommunications services.

Waggoner, 588 A.2d 1130 (Del. 1991) and Blades v. Wisehart, 2010 WL 4638603 (Del. Ch. Nov. 17, 2010), that corporate acts or transactions and stock found to be &#8220;void&#8221; due to a failure to comply with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law or the corporation's organizational documents may not be ratified or otherwise validated on equitable grounds. The term &#8220;defective corporate act&#8221; is intended to include all corporate acts and transactions, including elections or appointments of directors, purportedly taken that were within the power granted to a corporation under this title but are subsequently determined not to have been effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law, the corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any plan or other agreement to which the corporation is a party, where the failure to comply with such provisions, documents or instruments would render such act void or voidable. The term &#8220;defective corporate act&#8221; includes an &#8220;overissue&#8221; of stock and other defects in stock issuances that could cause stock to be treated as void or voidable.  204 thus provides a means of cure, as contemplated by Section 8-210 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code, for stock issued in excess of the number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue.  204 also provides a means to give effect to the provisions of Section 8-202(b) of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code, which provides, inter alia, that stock in the hands of a purchaser for value without notice of the defect is generally valid in the hands of such purchaser even if issued with a defect going to its validity, to address the suggestion of the Court of Chancery in Noe v. Kropf, C.A. No. 4050-CC (Del. Ch. Jan. 15, 2009) (Transcript), that the provisions of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code cannot validate stock that under the General Corporation Law is void. For purposes of  204 and also new  205, overissued shares are those issued in excess of the number permitted by  161 at the time the shares in question are issued, and &quot;putative stock&quot; is shares of stock that but for a failure of authorization would have been validly issued and any other shares that the board of directors cannot determine to be valid stock. For purposes of determining which shares are overissued or putative shares, in the case of an overissue, it is intended that only those shares issued in excess of the number of shares permitted to be issued under  161 would be deemed overissued shares, unless it cannot be determined from the records of the corporation which of such shares were issued prior to others, in which case all shares included in the issuance resulting in an overissue would be deemed to be overissued shares. Similarly, where a single issuance includes both valid stock and putative stock, or where trading in valid stock and putative stock precludes tracing of specific shares as valid stock or putative stock, and it therefore cannot be determined from the records of the corporation which of the shares so issued are valid stock and which are putative stock, all the shares issued in such issuance would be deemed to be putative stock. Ratification of a defective corporate act under  204 is designed to remedy the technical validity of the act or transaction; it is not intended to modify the fiduciary duties applicable to either the approval or effectuation of a defective corporate act or transaction or any ratification of such act or transaction. Defective corporate acts, even if ratified under this section, are subject to traditional fiduciary and equitable review. Subsections (b)-(d) set forth the procedures for ratification of defective corporate acts by the board of directors and, if required, the stockholders. In general, ratification requires approval of a resolution to ratify the defective corporate act by the board of directors. The resolution must contain the information set forth in subsection (b). Stockholders must ratify the defective corporate act if a stockholder vote would have been required to authorize the defective corporate act at either the time of the defective corporate act or at the time of ratification. In addition, any defective corporate act resulting from a failure to comply with  203 must be submitted to stockholders for ratification, regardless of whether a stockholder vote would have been required at the time of the defective corporate act. The quorum and voting requirements applicable to the adoption of such resolution by the board of directors are the quorum and voting requirements applicable at the time of such adoption for the type of defective corporate act proposed to be ratified, unless the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, any plan or agreement to which the corporation was a party or any provision of this title in effect as of the time of the defective corporate act to be ratified would have required a larger number or portion of directors or of specified directors for a quorum to be present or to approve the defective corporate act, in which case the presence or approval of such larger number or portion of such directors or of such specified directors is required, unless such director was elected, appointed or nominated by holders of any class or series of stock that is no longer outstanding or by any person that is no longer a stockholder. In the event stockholder approval is required, notice must be given to all current holders of the corporation&#8217;s valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and also to the holders of valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, as of the time of the defective corporate act, unless such holders cannot be determined from the corporation's records. The notice must contain a copy of the ratifying resolution and a statement that any claim that the defective corporate act or putative stock to be ratified is void or voidable due to the identified failure of authorization, or that the Court of Chancery should declare in its discretion that a ratification in accordance with  204 not be effective or be effective only on certain conditions, must be brought within 120 days from the validation effective time. Except in the case of the ratification of an election of directors, and except in the case of a defective corporate act resulting from a failure to comply with  203, the quorum and voting requirements applicable to the adoption of such resolution by the stockholders are the quorum and voting requirements applicable at the time of such adoption for the type of defective corporate act to be ratified, unless the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, any plan or agreement to which the corporation was a party or any provision of this title in effect as of the time of the defective corporate act would have required a larger number or portion of stockholders or of a class or series of stock or of specified stockholders for a quorum to be present or to approve the defective corporate act to be ratified, in which case the presence or approval of such larger number or portion of stockholders or of such class or series or of the specified stockholders is required, unless such class or series of stock is no longer outstanding or a specified stockholder is no longer a stockholder. Ratification of the election of a director requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of the director, except that if the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation then in effect or in effect at the time of the defective election require or required a larger number or portion of stock to elect the director, the affirmative vote of such larger number or portion of stock is required. Ratification of a failure to comply with  203 requires the vote required under  203(a)(3). Subsection (e) provides that if the act being ratified pursuant to  204 would have required a filing with the Delaware Secretary of State, the corporation is required to file a certificate of validation that sets forth a copy of the ratifying resolution, the date of its adoption by the board of directors and, if applicable, the stockholders, the information that would have been specified in the filing that would otherwise be required, and if a certificate was previously filed with respect to the defective corporate act being ratified, the title and the date of the filing of such previously filed certificate and any certificate of correction thereto. Subsection (f) provides that unless otherwise determined by the Court of Chancery in an action pursuant to new  205, each defective corporate act ratified pursuant to  204 shall no longer be deemed void or voidable as a result of a failure of authorization identified in the ratification resolution and that such effect shall be retroactive to the time of the defective corporate act, and each share or fraction of a share of putative stock issued or purportedly issued pursuant to such defective corporate act and identified in the ratification resolution shall no longer be deemed void or voidable as a result of a failure of authorization identified in such resolution and, unless void or voidable due to some other failure of authorization not identified in the ratification resolution, shall be deemed to be an identical share or fraction of a share of outstanding stock as of the time it was purportedly issued. Unless notice has previously been given to stockholders pursuant to subsection (d), subsection (g) requires the corporation to provide notice of the adoption of the ratifying resolution by the board of directors to all current holders of the corporation&#8217;s valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and also to all holders of the corporation's valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, as of the time of the defective corporate act to be ratified, unless such holders cannot be determined from the corporation's records. The notice must contain a copy of the ratifying resolution and a statement that no judicial proceeding challenging the validity of any defective corporate act ratified pursuant to such resolution, the validity of the ratification of such defective corporate act or the validity of any stock issued pursuant to such defective corporate act may be brought after the expiration of 120 days from the validation effective time. Subsection (g) also provides, for the avoidance of doubt, that notices given to holders of putative stock or to holders of valid stock as of the time of a defective corporate act, if given in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law applicable to notice to stockholders, will be entitled to the same presumptions and have the same effects as if such holders were holders of valid stock. Subsection (i) provides that the procedures in  204 and 205 are not intended to preempt or restrict other valid means of ratifying any corporate act or transaction, including any defective corporate act, that would otherwise be voidable but not void. Thus, for example, the general doctrine of ratification, as recognized by the Court of Chancery in Klig v. Deloitte LLP, 36 A.3d 785 (Del. Ch. 2011), and Kalegeorgi v. Victor Kamkin, Inc., 750 A.2d 531(Del. Ch. 1999), aff&#8217;d 748 A.2d 913 (Del. 2000) (unpublished table decision), and applied to a board&#8217;s adoption of acts taken by officers who may not have had the actual authority to take such acts, would continue to be an effective mode of ratification and there is no obligation to follow the procedures set forth in  204 to ratify such matters. Likewise, the doctrine of &#8220;shareholder ratification&#8221; described in Gantler v. Stephens, 965 A.2d 695 (Del. 2009), i.e., a fully informed vote of stockholders to approve director action that does not legally require stockholder approval to become effective, would continue to be an effective mode of ratification and there is no obligation to follow the procedures set forth in  204 to ratify such matters. Accordingly, the corporation's decision to ratify an act or transaction or any stock that is voidable but not void using common law methods of ratification rather than under  204 will not, standing alone, affect the validity of the act or transaction or of such stock or imply that the act or transaction is not valid or that such stock is void or voidable. Section 5 amends the DGCL to add a new  205 which confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery to hear and determine the validity of any ratification effected pursuant to  204, the validity of any corporate act or transaction and any stock or rights or options to acquire stock, and to modify or waive any of the procedures set forth in  204.  205 also confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery to hear and determine the validity of any defective corporate act that has not been ratified or ratified effectively pursuant to  204, regardless of whether such defective corporate act would have been capable of ratification pursuant to  204. If a defective corporate act or putative stock is ratified in accordance with  204, then no person to whom notice of the ratification was given may assert any claim that the defective corporate act or putative stock is void or voidable due to the failure of authorization identified in the ratifying resolution, or that the Court of Chancery should determine that the ratification should not be effective or should be effective only on certain conditions, unless that claim is brought within 120 days from the validation effective time of the defective corporate act or putative stock in question. After such time a defective corporate act ratified pursuant to  204 may not be invalidated or subject to the imposition of conditions in an action under  205, a ratification pursuant to  204 may not be invalidated or subject to the imposition of conditions in an action under  205, and any putative stock validated under  204 may not be invalidated or subject to the imposition of conditions in an action under  205. The factors enumerated in subsection (d) are not mandatory and need not be considered in every instance. Section 6 amends  251(h) to permit a merger agreement to include a provision eliminating the requirement of a stockholder vote to approve certain mergers if a statutorily defined minimum number of shares is tendered in a tender or exchange offer consummated by an arms&#8217;-length third-party acquiror. The subsection does not change the fiduciary duties of directors in connection with such mergers or the level of judicial scrutiny that will apply to the decision to enter into such a merger agreement, each of which will be determined based on the common law of fiduciary duty, including the duty of loyalty. Sections 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 amend  252(e),  254(e),  257(d),  263(c) and  264(e), respectively to delete the reference to the second sentence of  251(c) in order to reflect the 2003 amendments to the DGCL which (i) deleted the second sentence of  251(c), and (ii) added  146 to the DGCL. Section 7 also includes an amendment to reflect new  251(h). Sections 10 and 11 amend  262 to reflect new  251(h). Sections 14 and 19 amend  312(b) and  502(a) to deter the practice of forming &#8220;shelf&#8221; corporations with no stockholders or directors with the intent of renewing or &#8220;aging&#8221; the entity for use several years in the future. The amendments confirm the limited powers of the incorporator by clarifying that only a corporation&#8217;s directors or stockholders may authorize a renewal or revival, prohibiting an incorporator from signing an annual report after the initial report, and prohibiting annual reports from listing &#8220;no directors&#8221; except in the case of an initial report or certain reports filed in conjunction with a dissolution. Section 15 amends 382(a) to provide a means of service of process on a foreign corporation that consents in writing to be subject to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court in this State for purposes of a civil action, but does not specify a manner of service of legal process in the writing expressing such consent. Sections 16 through 18 amend  391 of the DGCL. The addition of subsection (a)(28) to  391 and amendments to subsections  391(b)(1) and (2) provide the applicable fees in connection with filings under new  204. Section 20 amends  503(e) of the DGCL. The addition of the second sentence of  503(e) clarifies that the filing of a certificate of validation pursuant to new  204 will not reduce the amount of franchise taxes due for any period prior to the filing of such certificate of validation or serve as the basis for a refund of franchise taxes paid or due for prior calendar years. Section 21 extends the effective date of certain changes to 8 Del. C.  377 from August 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014. Section 22 provides that the effective date of Sections 4, 5, 16, 17, 18 and 20 of this Act shall become effective April 1, 2014, and the other sections shall become effective August 1, 2013, except that the changes to Section 262 are effective only with respect to merger agreements adopted (or board resolutions approved, in the case of a merger authorized under Section 253) after August 1, 2013, and appraisal proceedings arising out of such transactions."}, "127": {"bill_id": 552057, "number": "HB128", "change_hash": "819fa6f65710c302eecce8438510de48", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB128/2013", "status_date": "2013-07-16", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-07-16", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Habitual Offenders.", "description": "This bill modernizes the language of the statute to conform to the current practice of the Court."}, "128": {"bill_id": 552017, "number": "HB129", "change_hash": "3a963519a1aecb44bfbec67d1eab9c3a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB129/2013", "status_date": "2014-06-10", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2014-06-10", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Access To Hospital Bathrooms.", "description": "This Bill tasks the Department of Health and Social Services with developing and implementing regulations that would ensure that hospital staff have the ability to quickly access a locked hospital bathroom in the event of an emergency."}, "129": {"bill_id": 552029, "number": "HB130", "change_hash": "befeac65187bf6125bbc8e323d6f3fef", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB130/2013", "status_date": "2013-08-27", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-08-27", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Regulation Of Manufacture, Distribution And Dispensing Of Controlled Substances.", "description": "State and federal laws limit the amount of nonprescription pseudoephedrine (&#8220;PSE&#8221;) consumers can buy to prevent diversion for production of methamphetamine.

The solution is a multi-state PSE sales blocking system: the National Precursor Log Exchange system (NPLEx) which the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators provides at no cost to states that have legislation requiring real-time electronic monitoring of precursor purchases and agree to use the system. Currently, 25 other states have adopted PSE tracking through NPLEx.

Votes: Passed 40 YES 0 NO 0 NOT VOTING 1 ABSENT 0 VACANT", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Bail Bond Agents.", "description": "Revisions to the bail bond statutes are necessary in order to curb abuses of the bail bond system, and better serve the citizens and courts of the State of Delaware. Under the statutes, the Insurance Department regulates a large contingent of bail bond agents. The statutes cover both surety bond bail agents, who post surety bonds issued by an insurance company, and property or cash bail agents, who post cash or property bails. Many agents operate both as surety bond bail agents and cash or property bail agents. This bill clarifies and expands the definition of property bail agent by including any person who charges a fee or a makes a business of furnishing property bail in court proceedings. This bill will allow the Department and the courts to monitor more closely bail agents by requiring them all to be residents of the State of Delaware. A number of states currently have similar provisions requiring bail agents to be residents of the licensing state. Delaware residency may be established under the bill by maintaining a principal place of business in the State. Nonresident bail agents who currently are licensed and who wish to renew their licenses will be required to establish residency and successfully pass the Delaware bail agent examination when their non-resident licenses come up for renewal in 2013. This bill will restrict participation by unlicensed persons in the bail bond business by requiring disclosure to the Commissioner of the identity of each person having or seeking to acquire a ten percent or greater financial interest in a bail agent&#8217;s business or any bail bond, and by requiring any person who acquires a ten percent or greater financial interest in a bail agent&#8217;s business or a bail bond to be licensed as a bail agent. The bill also provides that any unlicensed person acting as a bail agent is guilty of a class F felony. This penalty is the same as the one imposed by 24 Del. C.  5515(b) upon any unlicensed person acting as a bail enforcement agent. This bill will also more clearly authorize the Commissioner to impose the same sanctions upon bail agents that the Commissioner may impose on all insurance producers under Title 18, section 1712, in the event of agent misconduct. Going forward the State will require criminal background checks from both the FBI and SBI in connection with initial applications for licensure, and for each biennial renewal. The current statute requires only a background check from the SBI, and only upon the initial application. The bill also establishes tighter standards for solicitation, record retention, reporting requirements, and accounting for premiums that allow for stronger regulatory oversight by the Department. Uniform standards of record retention to ensure that the Department has access to tangible records when conducting market conduct examinations of bail agents is also required. These requirements will result in more transparency in the industry. Under current law, the premiums for surety bail bonds and the commissions and other charges for cash bails must be filed with, and approved by, the commissioner. However, unscrupulous bail agents engage in a practice of &#8220;undercutting:&#8221; where in order to get business, they obtain only a limited portion of the filed rate of commission, and do not enter into a written agreement, before posting the bond. This practice allows defendants to post bond and leave detention at potentially much lower rates than the courts would expect based on the rates, charges and commissions filed with the commissioner. Under the bill, bail agents are required to collect a minimum of 7% of a surety bond amount, or 20% of a cash bail, and to enter into a written agreement before posting a bond. Also, this bill will establish clearer standards for the return of collateral to persons pledging the collateral, prohibit any bail agent from using more than two trade names, and make minor corrections and changes to the current law."}, "151": {"bill_id": 557109, "number": "HB152", "change_hash": "288d340df9e71ecd24a9afc6a704bc75", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB152/2013", "status_date": "2013-05-30", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2013-06-25", "last_action": "Stricken", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 15 Of The Delaware Code Relating To General Elections.", "description": "This bill sets out a process by which a person may bring a complaint before the Commissioner of Elections if that person believes a candidate is running in violation of the residency requirements for a particular office."}, "152": {"bill_id": 557148, "number": "HB153", "change_hash": "9404b3b80b707030e032fb283691ccf5", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB153/2013", "status_date": "2013-07-16", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-07-16", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 4 Of The Delaware Code Relating Seizure And Confiscation.", "description": "This bill involves the proceeds from the sale of property seized due to violations of Title 4, Chapter 11, such as illegally transported liquor.

Section 1 of the Act expands the responsibilities and resources of the Data Collection Committee, which is overseen by the Department of Insurance. The section provides the committee with more frequent updates on medical cost drivers for the Delaware workers&#8217; compensation market as a whole, and allows the Committee to review company-specific medical cost information and direct examinations of companies that do not appear to be exercising sufficient oversight over medical costs. Section 2 of the Act implements a number of changes to Delaware&#8217;s medical cost control provisions for workers&#8217; compensation recipients, including a two-year inflation freeze on fees that would otherwise be entitled to an annual inflation increase, a reduction in the annual inflation increase allowed for hospitals treating workers&#8217; compensation patients (which exceeded the inflation increase allowed for other providers), inclusion of many procedures on the state&#8217;s current medical fee schedule which were previously exempted, and new cost control provisions for pharmaceuticals, drug testing, and anesthesia. Section 3 of the Act imposes more responsibility on insurance carriers to ensure that employers are complying with their responsibilities to provide doctors with a complete list of job opportunities that an injured employee might be able to fill while still unable to perform his or her previous job. This is an important step in getting injured workers back into the workplace more quickly, which impacts the length of time they receive workers compensation. Section 4 of the Act creates a statute of limitations for parties who wish to appeal a utilization review decision. The Delaware Supreme Court recently ruled that such a statute of limitations must be created by statute and not by regulation. Section 5 of the Act makes three changes to Delaware&#8217;s workplace safety credit program: it requires that the program be more rigorous with respect to inquiring about past injuries in a workplace before awarding the credit, it allows insurance company safety inspections which are at least as rigorous as those performed by the Department of Insurance to substitute for the Department&#8217;s inspections, and it requires that companies be compliant with their &#8216;back to work&#8217; responsibilities for injured employees before being eligible for the credit. Section 6 of the Act provides the Data Collection Committee with the authority to direct the examinations called for in Section 1 of the Act. Section 7 of the Act reforms the procedure used to scrutinize industry-wide rate requests submitted by the workers compensation insurance industry, creating an advocate in the rate-setting process for Delaware businesses and establishing a process where that rate advocate can gather the information necessary to advocate for businesses and effectively present their arguments with respect to rates to the hearing officer making recommendations to the Department of Insurance. Section 8 of the Act requires that both the workers compensation industry and the Department of Insurance specifically consider each of the reforms created by this Act and by new regulations accompanying this Act when setting rates in 2013.

Energy efficiency investments create in-state jobs, lower energy bills for Delaware consumers and businesses, prevent dollars from being sent across borders, encourage the development of skilled energy professionals and labor force in Delaware, stimulate innovation, and cause a reinvestment of Delaware dollars in Delaware. Efficiency investments lead to substantial environmental and health benefits from reduced air pollution, make homes healthier and more comfortable, increase grid reliability, decrease vulnerability to energy price spikes, increase energy security, and boost the economy. The Bill permits electricity providers to utilize a portion of electric energy efficiency savings toward achieving their renewable energy portfolio standard requirements upon achieving existing energy efficiency goals (15% by 2015). Reducing electricity consumption has the same positive attributes as renewable energy resources and through the process set forth in this Bill, will reduce overall customer bills. Adding another option for complying with Delaware&#8217;s renewable portfolio standards gives electric utilities greater flexibility in how they meet this renewable requirement while still providing the many positive benefits to Delaware citizens as previously defined in the statute. Additionally, the increased flexibility in complying with the renewable portfolio standards could also result in a lower cost to achieve those requirements. In response to the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) Workgroup&#8217;s report, the Bill clarifies and simplifies the EERS Act. This Bill enables the achievement of the energy efficiency targets through the identification of all cost-effective, reliable, and feasible energy efficiency and coincident peak demand reduction programs that reduce average customer energy bills. The Bill also eliminates the authority to impose an energy efficiency surcharge. Energy efficiency is instead treated as an energy resource and is paid for in the same manner as other supply resources, with an assurance that only programs designed to reduce customer energy bills will be approved and implemented. The Bill would reduce energy costs while increasing reliability and energy security for the state.

To protect the ultimate beneficiary, the funds must be deposited in certain approved financial instruments, as determined by court rule. This process also lowers the administrative costs for these smaller settlements, leaving more funds available to the minor beneficiary. Currently, court staff spends a large amount of time monitoring small minor guardianship cases for compliance, when such oversight often is not necessary, provided the funds are invested in proper financial instruments at the outset. In special circumstances, the legislation provides a mechanism to have the Court of Chancery directly involved upon a showing of good cause. By not requiring the appointment of a guardian for matters below certain monetary thresholds, the number of minor guardianship cases will be substantially reduced, allowing Court of Chancery employees to devote limited judicial resources and staff to cases involving either adult disabled persons or minors who receive a large sum of money and whose needs require access to that money while the minor is under age. This will allow for more oversight in guardianships involving the most vulnerable Delawareans. The legislation gives the Court of Chancery and the Superior Court, acting together and with the approval of the Supreme Court, the discretion to set the dollar threshold below which a guardian of a minor&#8217;s property need not be appointed. This flexibility will allow those courts to adjust the dollar threshold as necessary over time, or as required by changing circumstances once the legislation goes into effect."}, "226": {"bill_id": 603169, "number": "HB228", "change_hash": "bebb2199942dd78c621b684395142faf", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB228/2013", "status_date": "2014-07-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2014-07-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 31 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Child Placement Review Act.", "description": "The intent of this bill is to make adjustments to the existing code to be consistent with current practices, clarify ambiguities, and eliminate sections that no longer apply."}, "227": {"bill_id": 603339, "number": "HB229", "change_hash": "0d38579542fa1c3e938eb143212d5005", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB229/2013", "status_date": "2014-07-22", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2014-07-22", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Conditional Licenses.", "description": "This bill allows for a conditional license for the purpose of attending school or job training for anyone who has had their license revoked for conviction of a drug offense.

It assists judicial economy, reduces the time and cost of litigation, and shortens the time that jurors have to serve on a given case because they would no longer have to hear unnecessary long and complicated testimony. For many years, the inflation rate for future lost wages and/or medical expenses has exceeded the economic discount rate, which means that the present value of such future lost wages and/or medical expenses is equal to or greater than their current cost. Therefore, it is unnecessary to require expensive expert testimony presented by an economist which simply repeats a well known fact to a jury or court. Other jurisdictions including Pennsylvania, have arrived at this conclusion. Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, Supr. Ct. Of Pa., 421 A.2d 1027 (1980), (&#8220;Moreover, the Court finds as a matter of law that future inflation shall be presumed equal to future interest rates with these factors offsetting. Thus, the Courts of this Commonwealth are instructed to abandon the practice of discounting lost future earnings. By this method, the Court is able to reflect the impact of inflation in these cases without specifically submitting this question to the jury.&#8221;). And, also Gillingham v. Consol Energy, Inc., 51 A.3d 841 (2012), Pa. Super., Lexis 1061 at *54 (Pa. Super. 2012) (&#8220;...a plaintiff is not required to present expert testimony on past and lost future earnings in order to sustain a verdict...A plaintiff can base his proof in that regard on his own testimony.&#8221; (Emphasis added)). The result of this legislation will be that parties in litigation will no longer be required to spend thousands of dollars per case on obtaining expert witness testimony from economists about a matter that has been well established and accepted by Courts and the economic community, and has not been contested by either Plaintiffs or Defendants in Delaware. Other benefits of passing this legislation include reducing the amount of time Judges and jurors will have to listen to unnecessary and lengthy testimony from an expert witness about matters that are not in dispute. Furthermore, attorneys will no longer have to take pretrial depositions of experts about future medical expenses and future lost wages, and they also will not have to request, review and pay for unnecessary detailed financial reports. The legislation is party neutral and does not give any advantage to one party or another. This legislation also gives any party the option to present admissible expert opinion in either support of or in opposition to a claim for future lost wages and/or future medical expenses."}, "253": {"bill_id": 637527, "number": "HB255", "change_hash": "a3fd11a34260d19b3126c686758f2391", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB255/2013", "status_date": "2014-03-13", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2014-05-07", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (VETERANS AFFAIRS) in House with 15 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Driver&#8217;s License And Veteran Identification.", "description": "This bill would add information regarding veteran status to the Delaware Driver&#8217;s License or Identification Card upon request.

This bill would implement one of the Task Force&#8217;s recommendations to improve the funding of basic life support ambulance services in Delaware by requiring each county to contribute a minimum of 15% of the total countywide cost of basic life support services provided by volunteer ambulance companies within each county. The bill allows the counties the leeway to determine the best way to provide these funds; however the bill grants a county the power to support its volunteer ambulance companies through additional funding mechanisms designed solely for the support of volunteer ambulance companies, should it choose to do so.

In order to meet the new standards, volunteer ambulance companies needed to hire paid EMTs and ambulance attendants to ensure the availability of sufficient numbers of trained, certified staff on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis to meet the new response time goals. The authors of House Bill 332 recognized that compliance with the new goals and standards would impose additional expense on the volunteer ambulance companies; however, neither House Bill 332 nor any subsequent legislation has addressed the funding sources for basic life support ambulance service in Delaware. Increased costs, without corresponding increases in revenue, have eroded the financial stability of volunteer ambulance companies.

HJR 17 noted that it has been decades since a comprehensive review was made of these laws. HJR 17 further noted that it is in the interest of the State that &#8220;people be able to access the most appropriate mental health treatment, in the most appropriate but least restrictive setting, at the most appropriate time.&#8221; This bill is the result of recommendations made by the HJR 17 Study Group. It is important to note at the outset that the changes in this bill appear more comprehensive than they actually are because one of the primary changes made by this Act is the combination of Chapter 50 with those portions of Chapter 51 dealing with civil commitment. Thus, much of the stricken language of Chapter 51 appears as underlined &#8220;new&#8221; language in Chapter 50, but has not actually been changed significantly. Combining the chapters creates consistent definitions and a logical and structured process. The language and definitions of both chapters have been updated to refelect modern usage, current terms and promote consistency across the Delaware Code. Substantive changes were made to modernize procedures and provide better civil rights protections to patients. Much attention was paid to making a consistent process, so that people enter civil mental treatment in a consistent manner with due process protections and that similar protections and treatment philosophies are applied across the different levels of treatment. The voluntary admission process was revised to require a clearer showing of informed consent by the individual requesting to be voluntarily admitted. The proposal also reduces the timeframe to discharge a voluntary patient who requests discharge in writing from the current 5 working days to 72 hours. The proposal broadly adds additional safeguards and removes the ability to provisionally admit someone based on property destruction; it removes the ability of psychiatrist to bypass emergency detention through the use of provisional admission; it adds in explicit language that an individual who is provisionally admitted shall not be considered &#8220;involuntarily committed&#8221; for any legal purpose; but it allows for 48-hour admission following a 24-hour emergency detention. The following due process protection have been added after an involuntary inpatient commitment has been ordered: the order may not exceed three months; shall be based on the court&#8217;s individualized assessment of the facts and circumstances; at the end of the three month period, an individual is entitled to a hearing with at least a 14 day notice if continued inpatient treatment is ordered, hearings are held every three months to review the case. Other changes include appeal rules that better reflect Superior Court rules. Discharge requirements will explicitly extend to private psychiatric hospitals as well as DPC. This will not functionally change services already being provided by psychiatric hospitals because the majority of what is covered by provision is already required elsewhere in Delaware Law. Due process protections were added for youth. Parallel to the adult system, the Study Group recommends that emergency detentions be done only by psychiatrists and &#8220;Juvenile Mental Health Screeners.&#8221; However, because they are minors, consent for voluntary admissions to designated psychiatric treatment facilities or hospitals may only be given by a parent or legal guardian and such requests must be signed by a parent or legal guardian. Once admitted, minors or their parents or legal guardians may make a written request to the psychiatrist to be discharged at any time. Discharge may be conditioned upon the consent of the parent or legal guardian. If the parent or legal guardian of a voluntary patient requests discharge against medical advice, the involuntary treatment procedures may be initiated. At the recommendation of the HJR17 Study Group, consent for voluntary outpatient mental health treatment for minors under the age of 14 requires the consent of a parent, legal custodian, or legal guardian. However, for minors age 14 to 18, the minor or the parent / legal custodian / legal guardian may provide the consent. A minor, including those 14-18, cannot overrule consent provided by a parent/legal guardian / legal custodian. A parent/legal custodian / legal guardian may not abrogate the consent provided by a minor age 14 or older. Psychotropic medication requires the consent of the parent, legal guardian, or legal custodian. A different time frame is proposed for minors than adults for emergency detentions. When minors are emergently detained, the evaluation and treatment shall occur within 24 hours unless the parent or legal guardian is unavailable during that initial 24 hour period. In such instances the time period may be extended to 72 hours. Finally, the proposed legislation establishes the ability for the Secretary of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families to designate a psychiatrist or Institutional Review Board to review the emergency detention decisions of Juvenile Mental Health Screeners on an individual case or aggregate basis."}, "345": {"bill_id": 649213, "number": "HB347", "change_hash": "37e901248e6805dd2f01fdc57f2a222d", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB347/2013", "status_date": "2014-06-18", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2014-06-25", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (EDUCATION) in Senate with 4 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 14 And 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To School Safety.", "description": "This bill requires all new school construction or major renovation to include the following features: an intruder alarm, bullet resistant whiteboards, bulletproof glass in entrance areas and interior doors and windows, and doors lockable with keys on both sides.

This section amends  3803(d) of the Act to clarify that a defense of usury shall not apply to obligations of a beneficial owner or trustee of a statutory trust owed to a beneficial owner or trustee of a statutory trust when the obligations arise under the governing instrument or a separate agreement in writing. Section 2.

Otherwise, when the governing instrument is silent the default threshold will be a majority of the trustees. This section is consistent with  3323 of Chapter 33, Title 12 of the Delaware Code. Section 3. This section amends  3806(f) of the Act to confirm and clarify that unless otherwise provided in a governing instrument, a person who is not then a beneficial owner may consent to any matter as a beneficial owner provided that such consent will only be effective at a time when such person is a beneficial owner of the statutory trust. Section 4. This section amends  3806(g) of the Act to confirm and clarify that unless otherwise provided in a governing instrument, a person who is not then a trustee may consent to any matter as a trustee provided that such consent will only be effective at a time when such person is a trustee of the statutory trust. Section 5. This section amends  3807(c) of the Act to provide that an investment company maintaining a registered office and registered agent in the State under  3807(b) need only provide an address in the State, rather than a business address in the State, to comply with the requirements of  3810(a)(1)b. Section 6. This section amends  3814(c) of the Act to restrict the use of the word &#8220;bank&#8221; in the name of a statutory trust. Section 7. This section amends  3815(a) of the Act to expressly allow the rights or securities of, or interests in, a statutory trust or other business entity which is a constituent party to a merger or consolidation to remain outstanding upon such merger or consolidation. Section 8.

Section 11. This section amends  3823(f) of the Act to expressly allow the rights or securities of, or interests in, a statutory trust which is to be transferred to or domesticated in another jurisdiction to remain outstanding upon such transfer or domestication.

The Act clarifies the Department&#8217;s responsibility to assume control of a release situation and resulting cost recovery, and also expressly provides for contribution from other responsible parties. It also provides liability protections for lenders who foreclose on properties that contain underground storage tanks and explains what lenders need to do to maintain this liability protection.

Further, the Act amends the financial responsibility statutory language to be consistent with existing federal requirements.

During its last term, the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders. Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012). Instead, to pass constitutional muster, a State&#8217;s sentencing system may permit a life-without-parole sentence only if it also permits the sentencer to consider youth as a mitigating circumstance and to assess whether the law&#8217;s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes an individual juvenile offender. In Delaware, there are only two statutorily-mandated alternative sentences for murder in the first degree, death and a mandatory life-without-parole term. DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11,  4209. Neither may now be imposed on a juvenile who commits first degree murder. This Act will bring Delaware into compliance with the Miller holding by removing juvenile offenders from the mandatory sentencing scheme for first degree murder to one which gives judges a range of options up to life imprisonment. The judge will be able to exercise his or her discretion within that range using individualized criteria suggested by the Supreme Court; such factors are already an integral part of Delaware&#8217;s sentencing procedures. See, e.g., SENTAC Benchbook, 2012 (Jan. 2012) pp. 123-26 (describing aggravating and mitigating circumstances). In a recent term, the United States Supreme Court held also that the Eighth Amendment prohibits sentencing a minor convicted of a non-homicide offense to life without the possibility of parole. Graham v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2034 (2010). Current Delaware law allows a sentence of life imprisonment to be imposed upon a juvenile offender for a non-homicide offense and, as parole has been abolished, such a sentence would be a natural life term with no possibility for release. This Act reorganizes and amends the provision in Delaware&#8217;s Criminal Code that allows a court to retain jurisdiction to modify a sentence and reduce the level of custody or time to be served. Under this Act a juvenile offender sentenced to a life term for any offense other than first degree murder would now be eligible for sentence modification pursuant to that provision after the offender has served 25 years of the originally imposed Level V sentence. This amendment insures that any sentence imposed under Delaware law would comply with the Court&#8217;s decision in Graham which provides: &#8220;A State need not guarantee the [juvenile] offender eventual release, but if it imposes a sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term.&#8221; Id. To further insure compliance with Miller v. Alabama, the Act also provides a sentencing judge discretion to designate in the original sentencing order of a juvenile convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life, that he or she will be eligible to seek sentence modification after serving 35 years. Lastly, the Act would permit the sentencing court to order that multiple terms of incarceration imposed upon a person for crimes committed before the person&#8217;s eighteenth birthday may be served concurrently to avoid de facto life sentences in such cases."}, "560": {"bill_id": 531848, "number": "SB10", "change_hash": "f0489fc73ac5780314a9c44d7fc90c61", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB10/2013", "status_date": "2013-06-26", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2013-06-26", "last_action": "Enact w/o Sign by Governor", "title": "An Act Proposing An Amendment To Article Iv, Section 11 Of The Delaware Constitution Of 1897, As Amended Relating To Certification Of Questions Of Law To The Supreme Court.", "description": "This amendment adds the United States Bankruptcy Courts to the list of entities that may certify questions of law to the Delaware Supreme Court.

This act would leave in place the limitations imposed upon counties by Title 9 of the Delaware Code, Section 330 to regulate firearms and ammunition. According to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control, over 30,000 people in the United States die each year from gunfire. Many are children. Additionally, more than 75,000 individuals suffer non-fatal injuries caused by gunfire in the United States annually, including thousands of children. Therefore, over the next decade, the number of deaths from firearms in America will likely exceed 300,000 persons, and the total number of persons killed or injured by guns can be expected to significantly exceed one million persons. According to a report from the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund, in 2008, 2,947 children and teens died from guns in the United States and 2,793 died in 2009, for a total of 5,740 -- one child or teen every three hours, eight every day, 55 every week for two years. Over a four year period, the number of children and teens killed by guns in the United States will easily exceed the number of first graders enrolled in all of Delaware&#8217;s public schools in the 2007-2008 school year: 9,903 children. The 5,740 children and teens killed in the United States by guns in 2008 and 2009: Would fill more than 229 public school classrooms of 25 students each. Was greater than the number of U.S. military personnel killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan (5,013). The number of preschoolers killed by guns in 2008 (88) and in 2009 (85) was nearly double the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2008 (41) and 2009 (48). Black children and teens accounted for 45 percent of all child and teen gun deaths in 2008 and 2009, but were only 15 percent of the total child population. Black males 15-19 were eight times as likely as White males of the same age and two-and-a-half times as likely as their Hispanic peers to be killed in a gun homicide in 2009. The leading cause of death among Black teens ages 15 to 19 in 2008 and 2009 was gun homicide. For White teens 15 to 19 it was motor vehicle accidents followed by gun homicide in 2008 and gun suicide in 2009. The most recent analysis of data from 23 industrialized nations shows that 87 percent of the children under age 15 killed by guns in these nations lived in the United States. The gun homicide rate in the United States for teens and young adults ages 15 to 24 was 42.7 times higher than the combined rate for the other nations. Given that 2,800 children and teens die from guns each year, if no action is taken to curb gun violence, about 28,000 American children can be expected to be killed by guns over the next decade. For the 2012 school year, the total non-public school enrollment in Delaware for grades K through 12 is approximately 21,000 students. In 2010, 48 people were murdered in Delaware, and 38 of those were by firearm. In 2011, 41 people were murdered in Delaware, and 28 were by firearm. In 2010, there were 125 shootings in City of Wilmington, with 142 victims; 58 of the victims were under the age of 21, and 26 of the victims died. A report on the economic costs of gun violence in the United States issued in October 2012 by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health concluded: &#8220;Firearm related deaths and injuries resulted in medical and lost productivity expenses of about $32 billion in 2005. But the overall cost of gun violence goes well beyond these figures. When lost quality of life, psychological and emotional trauma, decline in property values, and other legal and societal consequences are included, the cost of gun violence in the U.S. was estimated to be about $100 billion annually in 1998. A new study has examined the direct and indirect costs of violent crime in eight geographically-diverse U.S. cities, and estimated the average annual cost of violent crime was more than $1,300 for every adult and child. Because much of these costs are due to lowering residential property values, violent crime greatly reduces tax revenues that local governments need to address a broad array of citizens&#8217; needs. The direct annual cost of violent crime to all levels of government was estimated to be $325 per resident.&#8221; The unnecessary human suffering caused by gun violence both nationally and in Delaware is enormous. The economic toll caused by gun violence in the United States and Delaware is likewise enormous.

This Act provides that the constitutional amendment to Art. I, Sec. 12 of the Delaware Constitution proposed bill will: (1) retain the express declaration of a general right to have bail set in a criminal case; (2) provide that the only crimes for which bail must be withheld is (a) capital murder where the evidentiary proof is positive and presumption of the accusation great and (b) Class A or B violent felony offense and under procedures prescribed by law; and (3) ensures that one condition precedent to bail being withheld in non-capital cases must be a finding that no bail condition or combination of bail conditions other than detention will ensure the safety of another person or the community. This change alone does not allow that any person charged with a non-capital crime can be held without bail and no person could be subject to a detention hearing in a non-capital case until the General Assembly revised Chapter 21 of Title 11 of the Delaware Code and the General Assembly and Courts &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221; the circumstances and procedures under which detention without bail may occur. With this change, though, Delaware may move forward toward the type of modern bail system that has been increasingly adopted by other states through amendment of their state constitutions, when needed, and the development of statutory procedures that provide, in extreme cases, pre-trial detention without bail. Under current Delaware law, the only circumstance in which one may be detained without bail is when he or she is charged with capital murder. This Act would have no effect on bail procedures and standards in capital cases. The fact that bail can only be withheld in capital cases, however, is inconsistent with the evidence-based and informed decision-making that the General Assembly looks to adopt through the Justice Reinvestment Act. While granting of bail upon assessment of the needs of the accused and the community is always preferable, there will be that occasion where the pretrial risk assessment that informs release decisions suggests that detention is the appropriate course. A Delaware state court judge cannot order detention in such cases but only attempt to set the bail so high that a defendant cannot make it. This is the first step toward completing the pre-trial bail continuum. Any legislation subsequently enacted or court procedures adopted pursuant to this bill would have to require individualized, fact-governed decision-making by the Court regarding detention in order to pass muster under the United States and Delaware State Constitutions. This bill also requires trial to be held within 90 days for persons being held without bail on non-capital offenses unless the person requests a delay. If trial is not held within 90 days with no request for delay, the person shall be entitled to bail."}, "587": {"bill_id": 540448, "number": "SB37", "change_hash": "6f84f7b3ecaada2ed670e78a9e3fb785", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB37/2013", "status_date": "2013-03-28", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2013-04-03", "last_action": "Stricken", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 11 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Crimes And Assault Weapons.", "description": "This act would add a new section 1462 to Title 11 of the Delaware Code and set in place a prospective prohibition against the manufacture, production, delivery, sale, or purchase of assault weapons.

Additionally, this section defines new terms to the chapter that are added by the creation found in Section 5. Section 2 removes the power to examine disciplinary records of foreign jurisdictions for new applicants. The AQB requires applicants deemed to be in &#8220;good standing&#8221; be granted licensure in Delaware and thus, this power is surplusage .This change is necessary to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 3 clarifies that reciprocal applicants will be deemed to be in &#8220;good standing&#8221; by their home licensure state without the additions imposed on new applicants. This change is necessary to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 4 requires all new applicants provide criminal background checks at their own expense. This change will be required by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2015. Section 5 creates regulation of Appraisal Management Companies which are cropping up all over the country, working as the middle man between mortgage companies and real estate appraisers. These middle men are necessary as Federal law bars mortgage companies from contacting real estate appraisers directly. However, Appraisal Management Companies are completely unregulated in this State. This bill brings Appraisal Management Companies under the jurisdiction of the Council on Real Estate Appraisers, sets standards for obtaining registration, requires principals of Appraisal Management Companies to submit to a criminal background check and prohibits the Appraisal Management Company from keeping the mortgage company the fee amount paid to the appraiser. Section 6 empowers the Council to issue a letter of concern to a licensee who the Council finds did not violate a statute or rule, but who could benefit from having the Council&#8217;s concern pointed out to her/him.

The bill would allow the injured person or party to recover civil damages and reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees. The bill would also allow the injured person or party to recover costs, prejudgment and post-judgment interest, and punitive damages, as such damages are generally available in cases of intentional fraud and criminal misconduct. The types of criminal misconduct that would give rise to such a cause of action would include, but not be limited to, perjury, tampering with physical evidence, criminal conspiracy, and hindering prosecution. The bill contains language that makes the provisions of the bill retroactive to the intentional fraud or criminal misconduct of an attorney occurring on or after January 1, 2007. Therefore, a person suffering loss, damages or injury, on or after January 1, 2007, due to the intentional fraud or criminal misconduct of an attorney, shall have the right to file and maintain the cause of action provided for in this bill. The bill is derived, in part, from a New York statute which grants a cause of action against attorneys for misconduct. The New York statute expressly allows an award of treble damages. The impetus for this bill arises from a case in the Delaware Superior Court involving brain and other injuries to an infant less than two weeks old. When the defendants whose negligence caused the infant&#8217;s injuries learned of the infant&#8217;s hospitalization, they altered the infant&#8217;s medical records in an apparent attempt to absolve themselves from liability. When a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Superior Court on the infant&#8217;s behalf, the attorneys representing the defendants learned of the alteration of the medical records and were provided with copies of the original medical records before they were altered. However, the attorneys not only failed to disclose the original medical records to the infant&#8217;s attorney, but also affirmatively relied upon the altered medical records to defend the case. The defendants testified under oath at deposition about the infant&#8217;s medical records and testified as if the altered records were the true, original records of the infant&#8217;s examination, despite their knowledge to the contrary. The attorneys representing the defendants at their depositions permitted them to testify as if the altered records were the original records of the infant&#8217;s examination, even though they had copies of the original records in their possession. The existence of the original medical records later came to light in a separate lawsuit, after the infant&#8217;s original lawsuit was over."}, "611": {"bill_id": 550611, "number": "SB61", "change_hash": "65a3a87bcfbb5c3ff61b3a2acbd9c83d", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB61/2013", "status_date": "2013-07-03", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2013-07-03", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Insurance.", "description": "The purpose of this amendment is to allow innocent victims of motor vehicle collisions to access their own underinsured insurance benefits in circumstances where the victim&#8217;s damages are greater than the amount of the negligent driver&#8217;s insurance policy limits.

The Downtown Development Districts Act is intended to leverage state resources to spur private investment in commercial business districts and surrounding neighborhoods; to improve the commercial vitality of our downtowns; and to increase the number of residents from all walks of life in downtowns and surrounding neighborhoods. This Act establishes &#8220;Downtown Development Districts,&#8221; a small number of areas in our cities, towns, and unincorporated areas that will qualify for development incentives and other state benefits. Municipalities must apply for District designation. In the case of unincorporated areas, counties must apply. Applications will be evaluated by the Cabinet Committee on State Planning Issues, which will make recommendations to the Governor. Following the initial round of applications, the Governor must designate at least 1 but no more than 3 Districts. Designation of the first 3 Districts must include 1 District in each county. Under the Act, no more than 15 Districts may be designated at any one time. As part of the application process, municipalities or counties must offer local incentives. The factors to be considered by the Committee when evaluating applications include, among others, (1) the municipality&#8217;s or unincorporated area&#8217;s need for District designation; (2) the quality of the District Plan; and (3) the quality of the local incentives offered. The Office of State Planning Coordination will prepare applications, establish criteria to determine what areas qualify as DDDs, and provide assistance to municipalities and counties during the application process. Under the Act, investors (both non-profit and for-profit) who make qualified real estate improvements in a District would be entitled to receive Downtown Development District (DDD) Grants of up to 20 percent of their &#8220;hard costs&#8221; such as exterior, interior, and structural improvements. The incentive is modeled after a similar program in Virginia, which has been extremely successful in leveraging significant amounts of private capital in under-served areas. Investors would need to invest at least $25,000 in a building or facility to qualify, and the 20 percent incentive would only qualify with respect to investments above $25,000. For example, an investor making $45,000 worth of qualifying investments in a District would be entitled to a DDD Grant of up to $4,000 (i.e., 20% of $20,000). The Act gives DSHA the authority to cap the amount of Grants and to establish further conditions and limitations. In addition, because Delaware&#8217;s Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program has proven to be a powerful tool both in preserving important historic structures and revitalizing neighborhoods, the Act also provides that 30% of the state&#8217;s yearly allocation of HPTCs will be reserved for projects in Downtown Development Districts. If by April 1 of each year any such credits are not allocated to projects in DDDs, such credits will be made available to any eligible project statewide."}, "740": {"bill_id": 644511, "number": "SB192", "change_hash": "f3fb2b59e5db1822be8424a8efbb3e53", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB192/2013", "status_date": "2014-08-06", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2014-08-06", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Motor Vehicle Safety- Responsibility.", "description": "This Bill respectfully responds and reacts to the well-reasoned decision in the matter State of Delaware Insurance Coverage Office v.

By 2012, human trafficking had become the second fastest growing criminal activity in the United States, following drug trafficking. The Uniform Law Commission, in response to a July 2010 proposal from the American Bar Association (ABA) Center for Human Rights, began its work directed against human trafficking. The Uniform Act on Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking (UAPRHT) received final approval at the ULC&#8217;s Annual Meeting in July 2013 and at the ABA&#8217;s House of Delegates in August 2013. This act, like the UAPRHT, presents the three-pronged approach that law enforcement and victims&#8217; advocates consider essential. Under the first prong, the act seeks to prevent and to penalize the criminal conduct&#8212;trafficking, forced labor, and sexual servitude&#8212;at the core of human trafficking. The act recognizes the forms of coercion that human traffickers use, including threats, force, debt bondage, abuse of the legal process, and use of a victim&#8217;s disability/mental impairment. The bill also offers a comprehensive definition tied to the act&#8217;s provisions on forced labor and sexual servitude. Sexual servitude gives rise to an enhanced penalty when a minor is made available or maintained for the purposes of commercial sexual activity. Also included is the requirement for persons convicted to pay restitution to the victim, while the Court shall order forfeiture of real or personal property used in or derived from human trafficking activities. Under its second prong, the act provides essential protections for human trafficking victims. Consistent with Delaware&#8217;s rape shield law, the act prohibits evidence of the alleged victim&#8217;s past sexual behavior. The bill also outlines special provisions for minors, including a diversion alternative for minors who are human trafficking victims and commit prostitution or nonviolent offenses directly resulting from being a victim, and classifies such minors as neglected or abused children under the Delaware Code. Further, all victims may seek applications for pardon and may move to vacate a conviction of and expunge charges for prostitution or other non-violent offenses that directly resulted from being a human-trafficking victim. Victims are also allowed to bring civil action against their traffickers under this bill. Under its third prong, the act promotes partnerships in the fight against human trafficking, elevates public awareness, and fosters development of coordinated victim services. A permanent human-trafficking council is created to develop a systematic plan to assist victims, collect human trafficking data, and promote awareness. Public awareness signs and the national human trafficking hotline number are to be posted in locations where victims of human-trafficking are often found. The act ensures that human-trafficking victims have access to benefits and services. The act states that law enforcement officers shall provide visa information to persons reasonably believed to be human-trafficking victims. Finally, the act amends other related statutes as necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act."}, "746": {"bill_id": 646467, "number": "SB198", "change_hash": "50f6d415d9e090929c7b0d802e4e4259", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB198/2013", "status_date": "2014-06-30", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2014-06-30", "last_action": "Passed by House of Representatives.

The bill&#8217;s language comes directly from the NAIC Model Law, Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations and is an accreditation requirement as of January 1, 2015.  Risk-based capital &#8220;RBC&#8221; is a method of establishing the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a health organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size, structure and risk profile. The term &#8220;health organization&#8221; means a health maintenance organization, limited health service organization, dental or vision plan, hospital, medical and dental indemnity or service corporation or other managed care organization licensed under Title 18. It should be noted that property/casualty insurers and life and/or health insurers licensed under Chapter 5 are already subject to Chapter 58 - Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Insurers. By operation, the RBC formula result is compared to the total adjusted capital of a health organization to determine if any action by the Insurance Commissioner is necessary. An excess of capital (i.e. net worth) over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this Sub-Chapter II and the formulas, schedules and instructions referenced in this Sub-Chapter II is desirable in the business of health insurance. These RBC reports, instructions, plans, etc. are intended solely for use by the Commissioner in monitoring the solvency of the health organizations within this State and the need for possible corrective action with respect to such health organizations. This bill also amends two provisions of the Insurance Code to make this new sub-chapter applicable to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and health service corporations."}, "751": {"bill_id": 646505, "number": "SB203", "change_hash": "e1fea8e71c357e76f2ae4bd9c351360e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB203/2013", "status_date": "2014-09-02", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2014-09-02", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Risk Management And Own Risk And Solvency Assessment (orsa).", "description": "This bill&#8217;s language comes directly from an NAIC Model Law for consistency across the United States and creates a new Chapter 84 under Title 18.

However, this bill would significantly enhance the protections extended to those servicemembers who are residents of this State or stationed in this State by enacting certain SCRA protections as Delaware law and providing the Attorney General with enforcement authority over such protections. Nothing in this bill would change the requirements that already exist under the federal SCRA with respect to procedures required to be followed in civil actions in Delaware state courts involving those servicemembers. In addition, this bill would provide civil relief to members of the Delaware National Guard who are called into active military service for the State of Delaware for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, which constitutes a group of servicemembers not currently covered under the federal SCRA.

In order to meet the new standards, volunteer ambulance companies needed to hire paid EMTs and ambulance attendants to ensure the availability of sufficient numbers of trained, certified staff on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis to meet the new response time goals. The authors of House Bill 332 recognized that compliance with the new goals and standards would impose additional expense on the volunteer ambulance companies, however, neither House Bill 332 nor any subsequent legislation has addressed the funding sources for basic life support ambulance service in Delaware. Increased costs, without corresponding increases in revenue, have eroded the financial stability of volunteer ambulance companies. In 2012, 40 of Delaware&#8217;s 55 volunteer ambulance companies reported they are now conducting ambulance/EMS operations at a loss. In 2013, House Bill 215 established the Ambulance and EMS Task Force (&#8220;Task Force&#8221;). In February 2014, the Task Force issued its report on the state of funding of ambulance and EMS services in Delaware and noted, &#8220;By some accounts, the public may begin to see diminished ambulance service in as little as 8 to 12 months, if steps are not taken promptly to meet the funding need.&#8221; The Task Force made 9 findings and 13 recommendations aimed at addressing this issue. This bill would implement one of the Task Force&#8217;s recommendations to improve the funding of basic life support ambulance services in Delaware by ensuring that health insurers, health service corporations, health maintenance organizations, or managed care organizations do not set their allowable charges below the costs incurred by the volunteer ambulance companies in providing an ambulance run and basic life support services."}, "756": {"bill_id": 647507, "number": "SB208", "change_hash": "1f86a9ca93af753cdfbabdfda62fdf35", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB208/2013", "status_date": "2014-05-06", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2014-06-26", "last_action": "Laid On Table in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 7 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Advisory Council On Tidal Finfisheries.", "description": "This bill changes the method of populating the Advisory Council on Tidal Finfisheries from gubernatorial nomination with Senate confirmation to gubernatorial appointment."}, "758": {"bill_id": 647794, "number": "SB210", "change_hash": "a445da4b30c3fb2347b9e4aa095fa29b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB210/2013", "status_date": "2014-06-05", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2014-06-30", "last_action": "SS 1 for SB 210 - Passed by House of Representatives.

In ATP Tours, Inc. v. Deutscher Tennis Bund (No. 534, 2013, May 8, 2014), the Delaware Supreme Court upheld as facially valid a bylaw imposing liability for legal fees on certain members of a non-stock corporation who participated in the litigation. Together with the amendments to Section 114, new Section 331 is intended to limit applicability of that holding to non-stock corporations, and to make clear that such liability may not be imposed on holders of stock in stock corporations. The change to Section 102(b)(6) is intended to clarify that any certificate of incorporation provision that imposes stockholder liability for the debts of the corporation must impose such liability based on status as a stockholder, and not on any other status or action of the stockholder. The change to Section 102(b)(6) does not, however, modify or limit the possibility of liability not arising from a charter or bylaw provision, but based instead on a specific act or omission of a stockholder, such as guaranteeing debt of the corporation or engaging in tortious conduct affecting a third person. Under new Section 331 and Section 102(b)(6) as amended, a provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would purport to require a holder of stock in a stock corporation to pay expenses incurred by the corporation, its directors, officers, employees, agents or controlling stockholders in connection with litigation initiated or claims prosecuted by the stockholder would be facially invalid. New Section 331 would not prohibit bylaw provisions permitted by Section 112(5), inasmuch as such provisions do not contemplate personal liability of a stockholder in the absence of the stockholder&#8217;s explicit affirmative consent (providing an undertaking to indemnify the corporation). Nothing in these amendments is intended to limit the power of a court to impose sanctions under applicable law or the enforceability of any provision included in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws that binds any person pursuant to any separate contract, agreement, deed or other instrument."}, "785": {"bill_id": 651635, "number": "SB237", "change_hash": "4ddc662dbe10c00dd56e48e48778ba94", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB237/2013", "status_date": "2014-06-03", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2014-06-03", "last_action": "Assigned to Public Safety Committee in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Ice And Snow On Certain Exposed Surfaces Of A Moving Vehicle.", "description": "This Act places a duty on the drivers of motor vehicles to clean ice and snow off of their vehicles prior to driving on the State&#8217;s highways.

This was followed by companion bill House Resolution 41 which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 9, 2005. President George W. Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation on April 4, 2008 making April 6 National Tartan Day. In April of 2008, then Governor Minner issued a statement celebrating the accomplishments of Scots-Irish Americans in the First State as part of a Scots/Scots-Irish Heritage Month. April 6 commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which asserted Scotland's sovereignty over English territorial claims, and which was a significant influence on the American Declaration of Independence. Canada has been celebrating &quot;National Tartan Day&quot; since 1993. The idea and motivation for creating a similar American holiday was provided by the Scottish Coalition, a group of national Scottish- American cultural organizations."}, "872": {"bill_id": 641354,
