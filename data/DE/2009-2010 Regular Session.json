The basic philosophy of this act is one of compromise and balancing the competing interests of employers and employees. Thus, although covered employees are granted an expanded substantive right to &#8220;good cause&#8221; protections against termination, available remedies are limited to reinstatement, with or without backpay, and severance pay when reinstatement is unfeasible. Compensatory and punitive damages are eliminated, except in cases where an employer retaliates against an individual for filing a complaint, giving testimony or otherwise participating in proceedings under this Subchapter. Pursuant to this act, employees who have worked for an employer for more than one year may only be fired for &#8220;good cause.&#8221; Part-time employees working less than 20 hours per week are not covered by the act. As to covered employees, this act extinguishes all common law rights and remedies against an employer. This act, however, does not displace or extinguish any rights granted to an employee under any Federal or Delaware statutes, administrative rules or regulations having the force of law. Similarly, this act does not displace or extinguish any rights granted to an employee under a collective-bargaining agreement or an express oral or written agreement relating to employment. Employees not covered by the provisions of this act retain all common law rights and remedies. This act does not apply to the State or its subdivisions or agencies, municipal corporations or private employers with less than five employees. &#8220;Good cause&#8221; for a termination is defined as: (i) a &#8220;reasonable basis&#8221; related to an individual employee in view of factors such as conduct on the job, job performance and employment record; or (ii) the exercise of business judgment in good faith by the employer. The requirement of good cause for a termination does not apply to a termination which occurs at the expiration of express term of employment or upon completion of the specified task or project to which the employment related. The provisions of this act cannot be waived except by an express written agreement of the employer and employee providing for severance pay in the event the employee is terminated without good cause. Any covered employee whose employment is terminated may file a complaint and demand for arbitration with the Department of Labor within 180 days of the effective date of the termination. An employer seeking a declaration that good cause exists for a termination may also file a complaint and request for arbitration. Arbitration pursuant to this act shall be governed by Delaware&#8217;s Uniform Arbitration Act. Either party to an arbitration proceeding may appeal the arbitrator&#8217;s award to the Superior Court of the County in which the termination occurred. The act will take effect 180 days after enactment to allow the Department of Labor to promulgate regulations implementing this act."}, "18": {"bill_id": 120863, "number": "HB19", "change_hash": "fffcdfc155db4a42de018fca3472dfdc", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB19/2009", "status_date": "2009-04-10", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2009-04-10", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 8 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The General Corporation Law.", "description": "Section 1. New Section 112 clarifies that the bylaws may require that if the corporation solicits proxies with respect to an election of directors, the corporation may be required to include in its proxy materials one or more nominees submitted by stockholders in addition to individuals nominated by the board of directors. Section 112 also identifies a non-exclusive list of conditions that the bylaws may impose on such a right of access to the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials. In particular, and in the interest of avoiding election contests instituted by stockholders having little or no economic interest in the corporation, Section 112 authorizes the bylaws to prescribe a minimum level of stock ownership as a prerequisite to requiring inclusion of nominees in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials. In establishing such a minimum level of stock ownership, the bylaws may define beneficial ownership to take account of ownership of options or other rights in respect of or relating to stock (including rights that derive their value from the market price of the stock). Section 112 also permits the bylaws to limit a right of access according to whether or not a majority of board seats is to be contested, or whether nominations are related to an acquisition of a significant percentage of the corporation&#8217;s stock. The bylaws may also prescribe any other lawful condition to the exercise of a right of access to the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials. Section 2. New Section 113 provides that a bylaw may require the corporation to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses incurred by a stockholder. Section 113 also identifies a non-exclusive list of conditions that the bylaws may impose on such a right to reimbursement. Section 3. The amendment to Section 145(f) adopts a default rule different than the approach articulated in Schoon v. Troy Corp., 948 A.2d 1157, 1165-1166 (Del. Ch. 2008). Under amended Section 145(f), a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under a provision of a certificate of incorporation or bylaw cannot be eliminated or impaired by an amendment of the provision after the occurrence of the act or omission to which indemnification or advancement of expenses relates, unless the provision contains, at the time of the act or omission, an explicit authorization of such elimination or limitation. Section 4. This section amends Section 211(c) to reflect the changes in Section 213(a) providing for separate record dates for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting. Section 5. This amendment to Section 213(a) permits a board of directors to separate the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting from the record date for determining those stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Under amended Section 213(a), the board of directors may chose a date later than the notice record date, on or before the meeting date, for determining those stockholders entitled to vote. This amendment is not intended to affect application of the doctrine expressed in Schnell v. Chris-Craft Indus., Inc., 285 A.2d 437 (Del. 1971). Section 6. This section amends Section 219(a) to clarify that, where the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote is set less then ten days before the date of the meeting as provided for under Section 213(a), the corporation&#8217;s obligation to provide a list of stockholders prior to the meeting is limited to preparing a list of those holders as of the tenth day before the meeting date. The amendment does not affect the list that must be provided at the meeting. Sections 7 through 9. These amendments to Section 222 reflect the changes in Section 213(a) permitting separate record dates for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting. The amended subsection (a) provides that where the board of directors fixes separate record dates, written notice under that subsection shall include the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote. In addition, subsection (b) is amended to make clear that the timing requirements for providing written notice remain unchanged in that instance and that the corporation need only provide written notice to those stockholders entitled to vote as of the notice record date. Finally, the new sentence added to subsection (c) provides that where the board of directors sets a new record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at an adjourned meeting, the board will be required to set a new notice record date in accordance with Section 213(a) and provide written notice to stockholders entitled to vote as of that date. Section 10. This section, which adds a new subsection (c) to Section 225, changes existing law by granting to the Court of Chancery the power to remove directors under specified limited circumstances. An application for judicial removal of a director must be brought directly by or derivatively in the right of the corporation. Such an application must be preceded by either a felony conviction or a judgment of the sort specified in the new subsection. Removal of a director is permitted only when the Court determines that the director did not act in good faith and that judicial removal is necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the corporation. Section 11. This section is a technical amendment to Section 228(e) to make it consistent with the revisions to Section 213(a). Sections 12 and 13. These sections are technical amendments to Section 262 to make it consistent with the revisions to Section 213(a). Section 14. This section amends Section 275(a) to make it consistent with the revisions to Sections 213(a) and 222 by requiring notice only be mailed to those stockholders entitled to vote as of the notice record date. Section 15. Section 15 provides for an effective date of August 1, 2009."}, "19": {"bill_id": 120864, "number": "HB20", "change_hash": "43734eb88111af6f3f11613c90c4a3bd", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB20/2009", "status_date": "2009-03-10", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2009-04-29", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (HOUSE ADMINISTRATION) in House with 3 On Its Merits, 1 Unfavorable", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Conduct Of Officers And Employees.

This bill advances that goal by several means. First, the bill authorizes parties voluntarily to agree to have a member of the Court of Chancery arbitrate a dispute, if the parties do so by a contract that meets the pre-existing requirements for using the mediation-only provisions that the General Assembly recently enacted, which set forth definitions for the types of disputes eligible for resolution. In general, this class of cases involve business-to-business disputes about major contracts, joint ventures, or technology. Specifically excluded are cases involving consumers. Use of this new option, like the option for mediation, is entirely voluntary. By this means, the Court of Chancery can remain at the cutting-edge in dispute resolution. Many federal and international statutes specifically identify instances when tribunals will stay or defer to the parties&#8217; decision to have their dispute resolved by way of arbitration. These statutes often deal with issues, such as intellectual property disputes, that are of importance to Delaware entities. Thus, this bill, if enacted, will permit Delaware entities to have disputes of this kind arbitrated by a member of the Court of Chancery by voluntary agreement. Because a member of the Court of Chancery would be handling the arbitration, the bill also vests the Supreme Court with authority to hear any action to enforce or vacate an order issued by a member of the Court of Chancery as an arbitrator. And, because arbitration is traditionally private, the bill maintains proceedings in the Court of Chancery as confidential but makes clear that the record will be filed with the Supreme Court, in accordance with its Rules and the Rules of the Court of Chancery in the event of appeal. Second, the bill authorizes parties voluntarily to agree to have a matter adjudicated before a Master of the Court of Chancery and to have the Master&#8217;s decision have the same force and effect as a decision of a member of the Court of Chancery. This will permit parties to make a voluntary election to have their matter adjudicated in a more streamlined fashion by agreeing in advance to avoiding the potential for a de novo trial before a member of the Court of Chancery. Third, the bill would authorize parties to agree that any adjudication before a member of the Court of Chancery, or a Master of the Court, would be final and non-appealable. In many matters, parties desire an answer and their dispute is narrow enough that even if they cannot settle, they are willing to agree in advance to live with the outcome rendered by the trial court. This section would give parties that voluntary option. Finally, the bill updates the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act to conform to evolving standards and to address inconsistencies with prevailing best practices. The bill does so by eliminating the option to seek an injunction in the Court of Chancery on the grounds that the claim sought to be arbitrated would be time-barred. A party believing that the other side&#8217;s arbitrable claim was time-barred would be required to present that defense to the arbitrator, along with its other defenses. If the arbitrator rejects that defense and enters an adverse award, the party arguing that the claim was time-barred could seek to avoid enforcement of the order by arguing that defense to the Court of Chancery in a post-arbitration proceeding. By this means, the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act would come into conformity with prevailing practice in the nation and eliminate an inefficient and cumbersome approach to addressing limitations defenses. Relatedly, the bill clarifies that the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act only applies to agreements when the parties specifically choose to have their agreement governed by its terms. In other situations, any consideration by the Court of Chancery of an application to enjoin or stay an arbitration, require arbitration, or enforce or vacate an arbitration order, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and such principles of law, equity, and procedure as are consistent with the FAA. By doing so, the bill makes clearer the reality that arbitration contracts in interstate commerce are subject to the principles in the FAA and that the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act is only applicable when parties make an express election to use it. This will simplify procedure for practitioners and the Court of Chancery. The effectiveness of the amendments to the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act is delayed for three months after enactment to give practitioners a period of prior notice."}, "49": {"bill_id": 120896, "number": "HB50", "change_hash": "586279c4fde97dfa15d55f20e735b670", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB50/2009", "status_date": "2009-05-14", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2010-01-13", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (COMMUNITY/COUNTY AFFAIRS) in Senate with 3 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Chapter 59, Volume 63 Of The Laws Of Delaware, As Amended, The Charter Of The Town Of Dewey Beach To Limit The Height Of Structures Within The Town.", "description": "This Act amends the Charter for the Town of Dewey Beach to limit the height of structures within the Town.

Although the cost to purchase and import wild turkeys is very expensive, the penalties levied on individuals who illegally hunt these birds are minimal. Currently, illegally taking a wild turkey is a class D environmental misdemeanor, punishable for a first offense by a fine of $25.00 to $100.00, imprisonment for up to five days, or both. To assure that the penalties imposed on individuals who illegally hunt wild turkeys more accurately represent the cost of replacing the lost birds, this act makes illegally hunting wild turkeys a class B environmental, punishable for a first offense by a fine of $250.00 to $1,000.00, imprisonment for up to 30 days, or both."}, "67": {"bill_id": 120915, "number": "HB68", "change_hash": "b3e40d142cd4b97638c1441ca8f31e84", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB68/2009", "status_date": "2009-05-12", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2009-05-12", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Habitual Offenders Status For Driving During A Period Of Suspension Or Revocation.", "description": "Under current law, if a person is arrested for driving with a suspended license and the judge finds that the sole reason for the suspension is that the person failed to pay a traffic ticket eligible for voluntary assessment, the lesser penalties for failure to reinstate apply in lieu of the penalties for driving during suspension.

The prior enactments, however, failed to make the connection that driving during suspension charges obtained under these circumstances should be treated like a failure to reinstate for purposes of determining habitual offender status. This act fills this gap by restricting habitual offender applicability of convictions for driving during a suspension or revocation where the underlying reason for the suspension is a failure to pay a voluntary assessment ticket. The most significant benefit of this legislation will be felt in the Justice of the Peace Court, where the Attorney General&#8217;s office does not regularly appear. In the Court of Common Pleas, it is common practice for a Deputy Attorney General to amend a charge of driving during suspension to failure to reinstate where the reason for the suspension is the nonpayment of a fine.

This bill also creates two new chapters in Title 13 of the Delaware Code, which are designed to be more user-friendly chapters relating to custody and third party visitation of children. Section 1 of the bill slightly broadens the definition of &#8220;relative&#8221; to include great-grandparents, grand aunts or uncles and half brothers and sisters. Section 2 clarifies that, in addition to children alleged to be dependent or neglected, the Family Court also has original civil jurisdiction over children who are alleged to be abused. Section 3 removes the grandparent visitation statute from Title 10 since it will now be governed by the new Chapter 24 of Title 13. Section 4 removes the grounds for non-parents obtaining custody of children from Chapter 7 since the new Chapter 25 of Title 13 will now govern how and when the Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families (&#8220;DSCYF&#8221;) may obtain custody of children. Section 5 ensures that Section 724 of Title 13 pertaining to interviewing of children in civil matters applies to all proceedings in Title 13 as well as to proceedings in Title 9 of Chapter 16. Sections 6 and 7 remove references to persons other than parents obtaining visitation with children as this will now be governed by Chapter 24. Section 8 inserts into the adoption statute the ability of DSCYF to provide adoption subsidies (which DSCYF currently provides in accordance with federal law) since Section 11 of this bill removes that language from Section 304 of Title 31. Section 9 creates the first new chapter, Chapter 24, which addresses the rights of third parties to obtain visitation with a child, including sibling visitation. Chapter 24 includes provisions governing who can file for visitation with a child (limiting it to relatives or persons who have had a substantial and positive prior relationship with the child) and limiting a parent whose parental rights have been terminated from filing for visitation except under limited circumstances. Section 10 creates the second new chapter, Chapter 25. This Chapter codifies the means by which DSCYF obtains custody of children and clarifies the rights and duties relating to DSCYF custody issues. This Chapter does not change the grounds for removal of a child or the rights and duties of a parent while their child is in DSCYF custody, nor does it change the duties and powers of DSCYF while having custody of the child. This Chapter consolidates the existing duties as set forth in case law, and state and federal law, practice and procedure."}, "104": {"bill_id": 120954, "number": "HB105", "change_hash": "2b2194aed03b87f737737c1bb05fce8a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB105/2009", "status_date": "2010-05-14", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-05-14", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 25 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Manufactured Housing In The State Of Delaware.", "description": "This bill establishes and clarifies obligations to maintain, care for, and remove trees of the owner/landlord of a manufactured home community and tenants of such community."}, "105": {"bill_id": 120955, "number": "HB106", "change_hash": "22228331ab611df058d277e9378641e2", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB106/2009", "status_date": "2010-04-08", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-04-08", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 7 And 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Powers And Duties Of The Delaware Open Space Council, The Parks And Recreation Council And The Delaware Council On Greenways And Trails.", "description": "This act implements changes requested by the Delaware Open Space Council.

The bill amends the definition of &#8220;cosmetology&#8221; to include singeing, braiding and pressing of hair. Pursuant to the proposed bill, individuals who practice in these areas must be licensed. Further, schools must become accredited. With respect to accreditation, a grandfather clause exempts schools that have been continually licensed and in good standing for more than five years prior to enactment of the statute. The bill changes the Board composition to more accurately reflect the licensee population. There will be 13 Board members: 2 cosmetologists, 2 nail technicians, 2 barbers, 2 aestheticians, 1 electrologist, 1 cosmetology instructor and 3 public members. Pursuant to the proposed bill, agents of the Division will have the authority to inspect shops and schools, both licensed and unlicensed. The Board will have the authority to require continuing education of licensees. Licensure requirements for nail technicians have been amended to update training and apprenticeship hours. A grandfather provision for nail technician apprentices is included. This amendment will bring Delaware up to the standards of most other states. Licensure requirements for instructors have also been clarified and updated. The bill states that a cosmetology instructor may also teach electrology, nail technology and aesthetics. A grandfather provision for licensure of barbering instructors is included. The bill creates two levels of licensure for barbers: barbers and master barbers. The type of license issued will depend on the applicant&#8217;s training and the examination taken. A grandfather clause is included. The bill amends the two-year late renewal period to one year and allows for the licensee to renew a lapsed license up to 4 years before requiring reinstatement. The bill amends reciprocity requirements such that an applicant coming from a state with less stringent requirements shall have worked for 5 years in the home state preceding application. The bill amends disciplinary sanctions to include a civil penalty. The provision relating to unlicensed practice has been changed to include fines for shop owners and managers. The bill amends the qualifications for licensure of aestheticians to update the education hours and the apprenticeship hours. A grandfather provision for aesthetician apprentices is included. In addition, the hour requirements for schools have been updated. The course of study must be not less than 600 hours. These changes are needed to bring Delaware licensure standards into line with those in most other states. The bill also updates the requirements for licensure as an aesthetics&#8217; instructor, again, to ensure that Delaware meets national standards. A grandfather clause is included: a licensed aesthetician who has been teaching aesthetics prior to enactment of the statute, and who provides the Board with proof of not less than 900 hours of teaching experience, is exempted from the section.

First, the maximum amount of any penalty that may be imposed for each offense is increased from the present $500 to $1,500 in recognition of the fact the current &quot;cap&quot; has been in existence for over twenty years and is no longer an appropriate maximum penalty for the more serious violations of Town ordinances. Second, this act specifically authorizes the Town to impose such fines as &quot;civil penalties&quot; rather than &quot;criminal penalties&quot;. This is consistent with recent legislative efforts to &quot;de-criminalize&quot; many minor offenses, is consistent with the &quot;majority rule&quot; and Delaware judicial decisions that prosecutions for violations of municipal ordinances are in nature of civil actions for the recovery of a debt (9A McQuillen, Municipal Corporations 27.06 (3rd ed); Vitelli v. Mayor &amp; Council of Wilmington, Del. Super. 199 A. 283 (1938)), and removes the potential legal uncertainty concerning the Town's ability to allow a &quot;voluntary assessment&quot; procedure under which a violator can choose to admit to a violation of a local town ordinance and deliver or mail in the appropriate fine, without having to appear before any court. Finally, this act eliminates the authority of the Town to sentence any person to imprisonment for a violation of a Town ordinance. No person within memory has ever been sentenced to imprisonment for violation of a Bethany Beach Town ordinance and this sanction is deemed to be antiquated and unnecessary. Its elimination is also consistent with efforts to de-criminalize many minor offenses."}, "178": {"bill_id": 121032, "number": "HB179", "change_hash": "0e515d115b557a1f16f0ef052ee444fe", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB179/2009", "status_date": "2009-07-22", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2009-07-22", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Chapter 237, Volume 51, Entitled An Act To Reincorporate The Town Of Bridgeville Relating To Sewer And Water Main Improvements.", "description": "This bill clarifies Bridgeville&#8217;s procedures for the construction, etc., of sewer, water main improvements and water systems."}, "179": {"bill_id": 121033, "number": "HB180", "change_hash": "30608b5354a3226960384fd4b7f7c44b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB180/2009", "status_date": "2009-05-28", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-05-06", "last_action": "Amendment HA 1 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 4 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Alcoholic Beverage Control Licenses And Taxes, And Direct Purchasing And Shipment Of Wine.", "description": "This bill would permit wine producers holding a valid license in this state or another state to obtain a license and ship wine directly to Delaware consumers so long as it is done through a common carrier with a &quot;Carrier Permit&quot;.

C.  88-101, et seq., (&#8220;DUCIOA&#8221;) that serves as a roadmap for those provisions of DUCIOA that apply to existing condominiums that were formed under the Unit Property Act. Section 2 amends  2202(18) to substitute as the definition of a &#8220;reserve study&#8221; under the Unit Property Act the current definition from DUCIOA for a reserve study, so that the two acts are consistent. Section 3 adds a new  2202(19) that defines &#8220;fully funded&#8221; under the Unit Property Act in order to provide guidance to an association for satisfying its reserve requirements. The amendment uses the current definition from DUCIOA for a fully funded reserve so that the two acts are consistent. Section 4 adds a new  2202(20) that defines a &#8220;nonresidential condominium&#8221;, which is a concept introduced in the amendments in Section 11 of this bill. Section 5 adds a new  2202 (21) that defines &#8220;nonresidential purposes&#8221;, which is also used in the new definition of nonresidential condominium in Section 4 of this bill. Section 6 amends  2211(1) to incorporate into the assessment requirements of the association for the condominium, assessments for the repair and replacement reserve that is fully funded as required by the amendments to the Unit Property Act. Section 7 amends  2211(2) to add specific reference to the fully funded repair and replacement reserve as part of the assessments. Section 8 amends  2219(5) to give guidance in those situations where because of the number of condominium units in a particular condominium it is impossible to make all of the percentage interests for each unit be equal and still add up to 100%. This amendment, which is taken from the corollary provision of DUCIOA, allows for minor variations due to rounding so that percentages can be equal, which is important for voting, without artificial manipulation, such as making one unit have either a higher or a lower percentage merely to add to 100%. Section 9 adds a new  2244 that is taken from the comparable provisions of DUCIOA in order to give a formula for setting a minimum percentage of the annual budget to serve as the repair and replacement reserve. Section 10 adds a new  2245 to the Unit Property Act to provide a formula for an existing condominium project, which will now be required to have a repair and replacement reserve, to come into compliance with the required reserve over time. The amendment provides a formula for how an association can achieve compliance over a certain number of years by requiring that certain levels of reserve be obtained that, once all budgeted annual payments toward the reserve are added over time, the amount of reserves indicated by the applicable reserve study will be achieved. If on July 1, 2009, the amount held by the condominium in its reserve is less than 25% of the level that is required for a fully funded reserve, the council of the condominium has 3 years to get to a point where, with future regular budgeted payments projected to be added to the reserve, the reserve will be sufficient for its purpose. If the amount held as of July 1, 2009 is more than 25% but less than 50% of the required amount, then the council has 2 years to achieve a fully funded reserve. If the amount held as of July 1, 2009 is 50% or more but less than 70%, then the council has 1 year to achieve a fully funded reserve. The intention is to give time to the council to get the necessary funds without overburdening the unit owners with special assessments for immediately funding to 100%. Section 11 adds a new  2246 to the Unit Property Act to clarify that, consistent with DUCIOA, a nonresidential condominium is not required to have a repair and replacement reserve, and may elect to exempt itself from the requirement by electing to do so in its declaration or by the vote of a majority of the unit owners. Section 12 provides for an effective date of July 1, 2009, consistent with the effective date of DUCIOA."}, "183": {"bill_id": 121037, "number": "HB184", "change_hash": "a93af3f607fd1fb821892e08871d80db", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB184/2009", "status_date": "2010-02-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-02-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 24 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Professions And Occupations", "description": "This bill requires all independent unlicensed clinical social work practitioners in Delaware to obtain a license for the continued practice of social work.

Specifically, the bill adds new administrative powers to give the Director of the Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice similar authority to what is provided to the Securities Commissioner in Chapter 73 of Title 6. Several sections contained in Chapter 25 of Title 29 have been revised and transferred to Chapter 25 of Title 6, so that the consumer protection statutes are all in one location in the Code. Section 1 contains a new Subchapter I that has been amended to place general provisions pertaining to purpose, definitions, private causes of action and remedies, courts of competent jurisdiction, defenses, and a statute of limitations at the beginning of the Chapter. Previously, Subchapter I was a collection of miscellaneous provisions. Section 2 contains a new Subchapter II that clarifies the rulemaking authority of the Director of the Consumer Protection Unit and adds new administrative powers. The Director shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders for any violation of the Chapter. For consumer fraud and deceptive trade practice violations, the Director is authorized to initiate an administrative proceeding in which civil penalties up to $5000 per violation are authorized. Section 2 also authorizes the Attorney General to appoint a hearing officer, who shall be a Deputy Attorney General not assigned to the Consumer Protection Unit, to adjudicate such proceedings. Additionally, in court proceedings where a violation has been shown by the Consumer Protection Unit, it shall be entitled to attorney&#8217;s fees. Section 3 contains a new Subchapter III that prohibits consumer fraud and unfair or deceptive trade practices. These sections closely match the language previously contained in former sections 2513 and 2532. Section 4 repeals Subchapter XI of Title 6, which consists of one section pertaining to enforcement. The substance of this provision has been moved to Subchapter II, which contains enforcement-related sections. Section 5 repeals the sections in Chapter 25 of Title 29 pertaining to consumer protection, so that the consumer protection statutes are all located in Title 6. Sections 6 through 25 amend various references throughout Title 6 (as well as one change in Title 25) to the old consumer protection statutory provisions to update those references for consistency with the new section numbers.

Thus, the fact that the company does not have a captive customer base acts as a check on the manner in which the company incurs expenses. In a monopolistic market, the same pressures are not present to act as a check on utility management, because utilities recover all expenses from their customer base. Thus, utilities may incur expenses that may not be prudent, but are not wasteful, done in bad faith or an abuse of their discretion.

The estate tax for non-residents will be calculated in the same manner as the estate tax for residents, the sum of which will be reduced by the ratio of Delaware taxable assets over total taxable assets. Sections 5, 6, and 7, reinstate enforcement and procedural requirements that would sunset with the repeal of the federal estate tax, such as the duty to file a Delaware estate tax return, creation of a special lien for estate taxes, and the duty to file an affidavit in cases where a return need not have been filed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code in effect on January 1, 2001 as updated by other provisions of the federal estate tax laws with respect to the duty to file a return and the calculation of the taxable estate in effect on the earlier of the date of the decedent&#8217;s death or the date immediately preceding the effective date of the repeal of the federal estate tax.

This bill also imposes a license fee structure that will reward video lottery agents for making capital investments by allowing them to reduce the annual license fee by up to 50% to account for the cost of capital projects, and that reduces the total license fee further if the video lottery agents are able to achieve certain table gaming revenue annual targets. As such, this bill promotes capital investment by video lottery agents, incentivizes the video lottery agents to achieve reasonable revenue targets, and creates additional new employment opportunities. This bill would also authorize the creation of a Lottery Commission, which would have responsibility for conducting hearings on disputed licensing and exclusion matters, as well as the issuance of regulations beginning in the next fiscal year. This bill would also authorize a Division of Gaming Enforcement in the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. That Division, part of which would consist of Delaware State Police investigators, would be responsible for investigating table gaming crimes, as well as the background checks currently being conducted by the Video Lottery Enforcement Unit of the State Police. This bill also makes certain changes to the Delaware criminal laws to ensure that prohibitions on transporting table game equipment will not inhibit the Lottery.

In an agency captive structure, the insurance risk on some of these policies is reinsured to the agency captive, thereby allowing the agents or brokers that placed the policies to share in the profits or losses attributable to these policies. Branch captive insurance companies are divisions of offshore captives that establish a business unit onshore. Many U.S. based companies have captive insurers organized in offshore jurisdictions such as Bermuda. In recent years, it has become attractive to issue certain coverages through the offshore captive insurers owned by these employers yet have these coverages regulated by an onshore insurance regulator. The solution is to bring an operating division of the captive &#8211; the branch &#8211; to the onshore jurisdiction and regulate this division in many respects as if it were a standalone entity. By adding agency and branch captive insurance companies to the list of captive insurance companies authorized in Delaware, this legislation will enhance the economic development potential of Delaware&#8217;s captive insurance laws.

This bill carries over without significant changes many sections and subsections of the former charter to the new charter and such sections are not mentioned in the synopsis. SECTION 3. STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT; QUALIFICATIONS FOR TOWN COUNCIL; COMPENSATION. Crimes that disqualify an individual for running for Mayor or Council in section 3.2 are expanded to include any felony, crime of moral turpitude, crime of dishonesty, or crime involving fraud, bribery or embezzlement (the only original limitation was being convicted of &#8220;a felony of any crime involving moral turpitude&#8221;). The age requirement to run for mayor is clarified as being 21 years of age &#8220;by the date of the election&#8221;. (The former charter made no mention of when a candidate must be 21.) The mayoral term of office in section 3.3 is expanded from 2 to 3 years. SECTION 4. MANNER OF HOLDING ELECTIONS AND MAKING NOMINATIONS. The election provisions governing Wyoming elections are heavily revised to be consistent with 15 Del C. Ch. 75 (&#8220;Municipal Elections&#8221;), and no inconsistencies are intended. The Town is required to post or publish notices of elections 20 days prior to the election date in five public places and in 2 newspapers. Pursuant to the Municipal Elections law, notice must be posted in the required manner, the Town must follow certain procedures to solicit candidates for elections, and candidates are required to make appropriate filings with the state. The right to vote is restricted to U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older, who are domiciled in the Town at least 30 days prior to the election, who have not been adjudged mentally incompetent, and who have not been disenfranchised under the Delaware Constitution. &#8220;Domiciled&#8221; is defined and the Charter requires voters to present photo identification and proof of residency at the time of voting pursuant to the Municipal Elections law. The Town may either enact an ordinance regarding voter registration or adopt the Kent County voter registration list. The conduct of the elections and absentee voting must be in accordance with the Municipal Elections law, and pursuant to the same law, voting machines must be used. Recounts and contests of elections must be done pursuant to the Municipal Elections law. The Election Board may consist of either 3 or 5 members, none of whom may be close relatives of any council members or candidates for office. The Election Board&#8217;s powers are set forth, including the right to break a tie vote in a municipal election by the toss of a coin. The period of time the Election Board must keep ballots after an election is increased from 10 days to 30 days (or if the election is contested or an appeal is filed, until the reviewing body or court decides otherwise). SECTION 5. ORGANIZATION AND ANNUAL MEETING OF COUNCIL. The list of individuals who may &#8220;swear in&#8221; a Town official under section 5 is expanded to include state and county officials presently in office. SECTION 10. FORFEITURE OF OFFICE. The reasons a council member must forfeit office are changed from just being convicted of &#8220;any felony or crime involving moral turpitude&#8221; to being convicted of &#8220;a felony, of any crime involving moral turpitude, of any crime of dishonesty, or of any crime involving fraud, bribery, or embezzlement.&#8221; The former charter required forfeiture if three consecutive council meetings are missed without being excused by Council, but forfeiture is now required if three council meetings are missed in a 12-month period without being excused by Council. SECTION 11. FILLING VACANCIES. This section is new to the Charter. Pursuant to section 11, if a vacancy occurs on council more than four months prior to the next annual election, Council has 45 days to fill the vacancy by a majority vote. If two candidates for a vacant seat receive equal number of council votes, the tie shall be broken by a toss of a coin. All vacant seats are only filled temporarily until the next regular election at which time the voters will elect an individual to fill the seat for the remainder of the original term. SECTION 12. CONTRACTS WITH THE TOWN. The ability of Council to approve contracts with council members through unanimous is eliminated, and the Charter now outlines that all contracts and conflicts of interest are governed by 29 Del.C. Ch. 58 (&#8220;Laws Regulating the Conduct of Officers and Employees of the State&#8221;), and any contracts that would otherwise violate this statute must be brought before the State Public Integrity Commission. SECTION 13. REGULAR MEETINGS OF COUNCIL. The Town must post notice of temporary changes of meeting locations in five places in Town (the former charter does not specify the number of locations where such notice must be posted). SECTION 14 OFFICERS. In section 14.1, the Town Collector of Taxes is changed from being the Town Clerk to the Town Finance Clerk. Section 14.4 amends the powers of the Mayor to include the authorization to act in cases of sudden emergency without prior Council approval, provided that Council may cancel or further implement the Mayor&#8217;s actions at a meeting within 15 days of the Mayor&#8217;s actions. In section 14.6 and 14.7, the bonding requirement for the Town Treasurer and Collector of Taxes is increased from $2,000 and $1,000 respectively, to $30,000. However, bonding shall not be required for either position if the Town maintains a general public employee bond that covers both. The age requirement for the Finance Clerk is increased from 18 to 21. The requirement that the Council select a Town Solicitor for a one-year term in section 14.9 is eliminated, leaving undefined the term for which the solicitor may be elected. The powers of police officers originally found in two places in the Charter are combined in one place in 14.10. Unnecessary language regarding the procedures whereby individuals are sentenced or imprisoned is deleted, and language in the current Charter granting the police authority to act 1 mile beyond the Town limits is also deleted. SECTION 15. ASSESSMENT OF TAXES. References to the Town Board of Assessment are eliminated, and section 15 requires the Town to adopt the Kent County assessment lists. The Town shall not have authority to hear assessment appeals except with regards to additions made to tax bills by the Town for other charges owed to the town. The posting date of the assessment list is changed from April 15 to June 1, and the locations where public notice must be posted are expanded from two public places to five public places. The Town&#8217;s taxing authority is expanded to include telephone facilities, television facilities, and gas facilities. The authority to tax farmland and to exempt farmland from taxation is simplified and clarified. The Town&#8217;s authority to exceed the $600,000 limit of revenue it can annually raise through taxes via a referendum is eliminated from the Charter. SECTION 17. COLLECTION OF TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES. A provision is added to Section 17 allowing courts to award the Town its costs and attorneys fees associated with bring actions to enforce Town ordinances or to collect amounts due to the Town when the Town is the prevailing party; provided that the Town shall have made written demand for payment or compliance, including notice that the Town may be entitled to collect its costs and reasonable attorneys fees if it is the prevailing party, to the responsible party prior to the filing of such legal action or proceeding. SECTION 18. ENUMERATION OF SPECIFIC POWERS OF COUNCIL. The transfer tax that may be charged by the Town is increased from 1 percent to 1  percent. Language stating that the Levy Court shall appropriate funds to the Town is deleted, as is language stating that the Town may regulate the operation of public utilities. The requirement that building setbacks be no more than 10 feet is eliminated (setbacks are to be governed by the Town&#8217;s zoning ordinance). The limit of fines for violating ordinances in 18.21 is increased from $500 to $1000, but imprisonment as a penalty is restricted to only civil contempt charges (under the existing charter, imprisonment could be a penalty for any ordinance violation). The Town is authorized to enact civil penalties for ordinance violations and establish voluntary assessment procedures. A detailed list of businesses that may be licensed or taxed by the Town is removed, and the Town is granted general authority to license and tax businesses. SECTION 19. USE OF TOWN MONEY. Section 19 no longer includes the requirement that all Town bills be approved by Council and that all proposed uses of money be recorded in the minutes. SECTION 20. FISCAL YEAR, ANNUAL STATEMENT. The Town&#8217;s annual statement of the receipts and disbursements of Town moneys shall be posted in 5 public places, but unlike under the former charter, such posting need not occur 10 days prior to the annual Town election (statements are not ready at that time). SECTION 21. POWER TO BORROW MONEY AND USE BONDS. The Town&#8217;s current borrowing procedures are eliminated and replaced with new borrowing procedures. The short term borrowing limit for the Town (to be repaid within five years) is $125,000 (accumulated outstanding principle) with at least four members of council voting in favor. (Previously, Council could borrow $125,000 per fiscal year with a majority vote of council.) The total borrowing limit of the Town is reduced from 10% (in the former Charter) to 5% of the assessed value of real property in Town. In order to borrow in excess of $125,000, notice, hearing, and a public election are required. At such an election, any entity or person owning property in Town is entitled to one vote and all Town residents are entitled to one vote. Section 21 defines the municipal purposes for which borrowing may occur, and it authorizes the Town to refinance bonds without public hearing and public election. To pay off bonds, the Town may tax all real estate or only real estate directly benefited by the borrowing. Section 21 authorizes the Town to prescribe the form of bond and protects council members from being personally liable for repaying the bond. Section 21 also authorizes the Town to sell bonds at public or private sale, and it creates a statute of limitations of 60 days (from the date notice is published in a newspaper) after which the issuance of bonds cannot be contested. SECTION 23. STREETS AND ALLEYS. This section is new to the Charter. To alter streets under these new procedures, the Town must adopt a resolution setting forth the details of a hearing whereat the matter will be discussed. Property owners affected by the proposed change must be notified. Section 23 dictates, in accordance with state law, compensation for property that is condemned or acquired; this section also outlines how abandoned or vacated streets may be disposed of by the Town. SECTION 32. FINES. The limit on fines that may be imposed by the Town is reduced from $5,000 to $1,000. SECTION 33. SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT. The Town is expressly authorized to regulate subdivision and land development. The Town may regulate combining and partitioning land, as well as subdivision and site plans, and it may require impact fees, dedication of land, or money in lieu of land in order to pay for municipal and public improvements having a rational nexus to the proposed development. The Town may adopt procedures to insure compliance with ordinances and to secure financial guarantees for the completion of improvements, and the Town may require all plans, plots, and plats be approved by the Town before being recorded at the office of the Recorder of Deeds in and for Kent County. SECTION 34. ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY. The annexation procedures are altered to require that notice of the annexation be published in 4 public places and on each parcel proposed for annexation (the former charter authorized posting in a newspaper or on property in both the Town and annexation area). The annexation procedures are clarified to require a special election where all the owners of record of the territory proposed for annexation did not request annexation (in the former charter, a special election was only required if five or more property owners, but not all of the property owners, requested annexation). For annexations where special elections are required (i.e. where all of the record owners have not requested annexation), an annexation shall only be approved pursuant to a majority vote of the Town residents and a majority vote of the residents of the territory proposed for annexation.

This bill is intended to preserve and further Delaware&#8217;s pre-eminence in offering cost-effective options for resolving business disputes, particularly those involving commercial matters, by means of arbitration and mediation. This bill advances that goal by several means: First, the bill authorizes parties voluntarily to agree to have a member of the Superior Court arbitrate or mediate a business dispute. In general, this class of cases involves disputes about significant contracts or commercial matters. Specifically excluded from the application of this proposed legislation are cases involving consumers. In addition, use of this new option is entirely voluntary. This bill, if enacted, will permit parties to have disputes arbitrated or mediated by a member of the Superior Court by voluntary agreement. Because a member of the Superior Court would be handling the arbitration, the bill also vests the Supreme Court with authority to hear any action to enforce or vacate an Order issued by a member of the Superior Court as an arbitrator. Further, because arbitration is traditionally private, the bill maintains proceedings in the Superior Court as confidential but makes clear that the record will be filed with the Supreme Court, in accordance with its Rules and the Rules of the Superior Court in the event of appeal."}, "432": {"bill_id": 206015, "number": "HB434", "change_hash": "5b77cfdf2060f541c2bcef4ae492bf92", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB434/2009", "status_date": "2010-06-02", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-06-02", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to Public Safety & Homeland Security Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Rules Of The Road", "description": "This bill is intended to prohibit slower moving vehicles from driving in the left lane and blocking traffic, which commonly leads to road rage and has motivated several other states to adopt &#8220;left lane&#8221; laws.

Section 1 broadens the scope of hospital disciplinary actions that must be reported to the Board. Some hospitals implement short-term disciplinary actions for which no report is made to the Board. The proposed revision would require all hospital disciplinary actions affecting privileges at a hospital to be reported to the Board. Section 2 requires physicians to report any civil or criminal investigation against them in any jurisdiction that concerns their licensure. Section 3 requires the board to permanently revoke the certificate to practice of someone convicted of a felony sexual offense. Sections 4-6 amend the definition of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; to improve and clarify the reporting of such conduct. Section 4 clarifies that the obligation of law enforcement to report unprofessional conduct by a physician is not limited to situations in which a conviction or admission has been obtained. Section 5 alters part of the definition of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; to give the Board additional flexibility in evaluating whether a physician's conduct in the practice of medicine is so deficient as to require action by the Board, and to state expressly that sexual misconduct can be a basis for discipline. Section 6 provides that the failure to report unprofessional conduct by persons with a duty to do so is a violation subject to the disciplinary authority of the Board of Medical Practice, and can be enforced by the Board by means of a fine or limitations on the license to practice. Section 7 clarifies the duty of law enforcement agencies to report criminal conduct of a physician to the Division of Professional Regulation and to report when the criminal investigation is complete. Section 8 eliminates the requirement that reports to the Board by persons without a mandatory reporting obligation can be made orally, and need not be in writing. Section 9 requires the Board of Medical Practice to report the receipt of a complaint involving potential criminal conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the Delaware Department of Justice. Sections 10-13 simplify the investigatory process of the Board and clarify the responsibilities of law enforcement and the Division of Professional Regulation when a complaint is made about allegedly criminal conduct by a physician. These sections build on current law requiring the Executive Director to communicate with the Department of Justice. Pursuant to these new sections, the Department of Justice could make a written request to the Executive Director of the Board to suspend any current or pending investigation, and that request would suspend the Executive Director's duties during an investigation. Sections 14-19 permit the Board to appoint a hearing officer to conduct hearings for the Board. Those sections also open to the public certain previously closed panel hearings and Board disciplinary hearings. Sections 20-21 improve public transparency for the Board of Medical Practice. Sections 20 enables the Department of Justice to obtain information that would be otherwise confidential concerning the Board of Medical Practice, Medical Society, and peer review organizations. Section 21 provides that the confidentiality of certain records concerning Board of Medical Practice reviews does not apply where disciplinary action was taken by the Board. Section 22 provides that the Board of Medical Practice may, after notice and a hearing, appoint a custodian of patient records in the event patients cannot access their records because of a physician&#8217;s mental or physical incapacity or because a physician abandons or involuntarily discontinues his or her practice. The custodian of records will return patient records to the patients by the same procedures that apply to a physician who either voluntarily discontinues a medical practice or dies. Sections 23-25 of the bill amend the standard investigatory procedures of the Division of Professional Regulation for all affected boards to make certain clarifying changes and include provisions by which the Delaware Department of Justice can suspend pending investigations where such investigation may adversely impact an ongoing criminal, civil or other investigation. Section 26 makes certain changes to the authority of the Division of Professional Regulation. The section requires the Division of Professional Regulation to report potential criminal conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the Delaware Department of Justice. It also requires the Division to subscribe to a national licensing databank service to improve its notification of out-of-state disciplinary action. Finally, the section gives the Division the power to retain hearing officers to handle evidentiary hearings and other matters."}, "458": {"bill_id": 207675, "number": "HB460", "change_hash": "17a90d2e5a0d0b43157f3856318d6720", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB460/2009", "status_date": "2010-06-24", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-06-24", "last_action": "Introduced in House and assigned to Health & Human Development Committee", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 9 And Title 22 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Accessibility For Persons With Disabilities.", "description": "This bill requires counties and municipalities within the State to adopt the Standards for Accessible Design in Appendix A to 28 CFR Part 36 and to enforce the requirements set forth in the Standards for Accessible Design."}, "459": {"bill_id": 206529, "number": "HB461", "change_hash": "434854aff89b7535a654e6f74cc4221f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB461/2009", "status_date": "2010-06-10", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-06-16", "last_action": "Stricken", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Student Academic Reward Scholarship At Wilmington University.", "description": "This Act creates the Delaware Student Academic Reward Scholarship Program.

This bill phases out the two tier licensure structure in Delaware. Currently, the Board of Massage and Bodywork issues licenses to massage and bodywork therapists and certificates to massage technicians. Licensed therapists are required to complete at least 500 hours of education and pass a certification examination. Massage technicians are required to complete 300 hours of education and are not required to take an examination. Delaware is the only state to have this two tier system. The intent of this bill is to ultimately eliminate the massage technician category and require all practitioners to become licensed therapists. The higher educational requirements and the examination requirement will serve to improve practitioner training and competence and thus will benefit the recipients of massage services. Upon enactment, the Board will no longer accept applications for or issue massage technician certificates. However, technicians who maintain current, active certificates will have a three year window of opportunity to upgrade to licensure as therapists. To achieve licensure, massage technicians will be required to successfully complete an examination. No further education will be required. Pursuant to this bill, three years after enactment, the Board composition will be modified to reflect the elimination of the massage technician category. The Board will consist of four licensed massage and bodywork therapists and three public members. This bill expands the powers of the Board to include adoption of rules pertaining to advertising and unprofessional conduct by licensees and the adoption of a Client Disclosure Form, to be used by certified massage technicians. The form will require technicians to disclose to the public that they are not licensed therapists. This bill also amends the requirements for licensure to enable the Board to take into account the applicant's professional disciplinary and criminal history. Further, all applicants will be required to undergo a criminal background check. This bill expands the grounds for discipline to include unprofessional conduct, which shall be specified further in the Board's rules and regulations. Further, where a licensee is found guilty of a violation of the Board's law or rules, this bill gives the Board the discretion to impose a monetary penalty not to exceed $500 for each violation.

Although 20 Del. C.  3116 provides for the Governor to suspend the provisions of regulatory statutes prescribing the conduct of state business, and the orders, rules, and regulations of state agencies if strict compliance would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, it is not clear that this provision would apply to the operation of the criminal and civil courts. This legislation provides for the continuing operation of the courts during an emergency by clarifying that the Chief Justice has the authority to take necessary steps to ensure their orderly functioning during an emergency. Specifically, this legislation: 1) Grants the Chief Justice the authority to declare a judicial emergency when there are emergency circumstances affecting one or more court facilities. The order declaring a judicial emergency shall be limited to an initial duration of 30 days, but may be modified or extended for additional 30 day periods. In an order declaring a judicial emergency, the Chief Justice may also: Order that a court may operate in a county other than the county in which it is normally located. Extend statutes of limitations and time periods prescribed by statute as well as those time limitations prescribed by court rule or administrative directive which the Chief Justice already has the authority to extend pursuant to his authority under Art. IV, Section 13 of the Delaware Constitution. Declare that specific proceedings not normally conducted by audiovisual device may be conducted in this manner. When such usage is not otherwise authorized by statute or court rule, an explanation of the compelling state interest in such usage shall be included in the order Take such other actions as the Chief Justice reasonably believes necessary for the continued operation of the courts during a judicial emergency. 2) Provides that the host county shall be a proper venue; 3) Establishes that its provisions shall preempt and supersede but not repeal any conflicting provisions of this Code or any other provision of law. Thus, for example, a judicial emergency does not need to be declared by the Chief Justice for a court location to be moved from one location to another in the same county during an emergency pursuant to 10 Del. C.  1903. However, if the nature of the emergency requires a move outside the county, the Chief Justice may declare a judicial emergency pursuant to this legislation and this legislation will preempt 10 Del. C.  1903 which permits a move only within the county (except for the Supreme Court).

The lawful ownership of firearms is a matter of choice by law-abiding citizens and the facts of such ownership are a matter of privacy in need of protection. Agents of the federal government are prohibited by federal law from creating lists and databases of private gun-owners and transactions yet other jurisdictions have experienced situations where federal law enforcement agents have attempted to skirt the federal law by asking local law enforcement to gather and compile that data for them.

The provision that states that only &#8220;capital offenses&#8221; are not bailable first appeared in its present form in the Delaware Constitution of 1792. At that time, &#8220;capital offenses&#8221; included many more offenses than the term does today, when the only capital offense is murder first degree, 11 Del. C. 636, when there is a statutory aggravating factor. For example, in 1792, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and burglary were capital offenses, and therefore included within the non-bailable classification.

This Act sets the &#8220;default&#8221; income allocation in certain sections of Subchapter IV of Chapter 61 at 5 percent rather than at 10 percent in order to reflect a rate that appears to be closer to the historical norm than the rates that were current when the Uniform Principal and Income Act was being drafted. This Act also extends the provisions of Section 61-413 to all income beneficiaries rather than merely spousal beneficiaries; accordingly, an income beneficiary, under appropriate circumstances consistent with the provisions of Title 12 as a whole and Section 3302 in particular, may be entitled to relief under Section 61-413 or under the existing law of this State in Delaware Trust Company v.

The Bill creates an exception to a state&#8217;s criminal laws to permit the doctor-advised medical use of marijuana by patients with serious medical conditions. A patient would only be protected from arrest of controlled substance laws if his or her physician certifies, in writing, that the patient has a specified debilitating medical condition and that the patient would receive therapeutic benefit from medical marijuana. The patient would send a copy of the written certification to the state Department of Health and Social Services and the Department would issue an ID card after verifying the information. Police officers could verify an ID card&#8217;s validity with the Department. As long as the patient is in compliance with the law, there would be no arrest. Patients would be allowed to possess up to 6 ounces and to cultivate up to 12 plants for their medical use. Six ounces is less than the federal government has determined is a one-month supply for patients in the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program.1 Twelve plants mirrors the limits of the most recent medical marijuana laws in Rhode Island and Michigan, which are designed to ensure that the patient has an adequate supply of dried usable marijuana. Both limits are conservative, and are significantly less than the 24 ounces and 15 plants that the Washington State Department of Health recently determined constituted an adequate 60-day supply. All cultivation would have to occur in an enclosed, locked facility. Many patients are unable to cultivate their own supply, so the legislation allows them to designate a caregiver or two who would also receive an ID card. Each caregiver may assist no more than five qualifying patients. The legislation would also allow for the state-regulated, non-profit distribution of medical marijuana. The Department of Health and Social Services would issue registration certificates to qualified applicants, who would have to abide by the rules on security, recordkeeping, and oversight provided for by the model medical marijuana legislation, in addition to any additional rules that the Department may develop. All dispensaries would be subject to random inspection and all of their staff would have to register with the Department of health. It is important that the law provide for both caregivers and dispensaries, since patients in rural areas are unlikely to have access to dispensaries, and because many low-income patients will not be able to afford medical marijuana at dispensaries. In addition, very ill patients would need a caregiver to pick up their medicine for them. The Bill would also provide a medical necessity affirmative defense that patients who needed more marijuana than was provided for by rule or who did not possess their ID cards can raise in court. This is an important provision, as some legitimate patients will not register because their doctors will not sign a written certification due to an unwarranted fear of federal repercussions. The Bill maintains commonsense restrictions on the medical use of marijuana, including prohibitions on public use of marijuana and driving under the influence of marijuana. Employers are not required to allow patients to be impaired at work or to allow the possession of marijuana at a workplace. Insurance providers would not have to cover medical marijuana."}, "707": {"bill_id": 121434, "number": "SB95", "change_hash": "7efb9e025ea6a78619fa00471231912e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB95/2009", "status_date": "2009-05-13", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2009-05-13", "last_action": "Assigned to Finance Committee in Senate", "title": "An Act To Create Four School Districts And To Consolidate The Existing Nineteen Districts Therein.", "description": "This Bill provides for consolidation of the current public school districts into four districts.

This system eliminates totally unnecessary health insurance company multi-payer brokers and will save approximately 40 percent of our total health care funds now wasted on costly paperwork, profits, advertising, lobbying, fraud, etc. Hard-working citizens provide approximately 90 percent of our state's health care funds via taxes (70%) and out-of-pocket expenses (20%) and this Act enables these funds to provide universal, comprehensive health care coverage to them and their families. These annual savings and a stabilized funding structure with accountable budgets will enable our state to provide the following health care benefits to all citizens and create a magnet-type economy that will both attract and retain private businesses: . Comprehensive health care coverage (physicians and specialists, hospital needs, long-term care of all kinds, pharmaceutical drugs, dental care, mental health treatment, drug rehabilitation, all needed therapies, special equipment and aids, laboratory tests, family planning, etc.) from conception until death without any extra health insurance or out-of-pocket expense for co-payments or deductibles; . Eliminates the huge annual increases in health care costs; only the lower rate of inflation will apply; . Will return all health care decision-making to physicians, dentists and other health care professionals whereas now they have to obtain permission on some decisions from profit-protecting administrators of health insurance companies; . Eliminates the pauper requirement that one must give up all savings and property before receiving Medicare/Medicaid funds for long-term care; . Will eliminate huge health care debts, a major cause of personal bankruptcies and the ability to buy and keep a home; . Will eliminate the destructive, debilitating effects of chronic stress and anxiety on our uninsured, underinsured and their families; . Will significantly correct our ranking of from 45th to lower among the states on health care challenges such as well babies, women's health, cancer, etc.; and . Personal health care savings will add more than $1 billion annually to our state's economy. This Act will be administered by a 15-member Delaware Health Security Board comprised as follows: State Secretary of the Health and Social Services Department, appointed by the Governor; Two members from both the State House of Representatives and the State Committees concerned with health care issues; Five members from state health professional organizations and five members from state consumer organizations that have endorsed single payer reform at least 5 years before passage of this Act. There will be a County Advisory Council in each of our state's three counties. The appointments and membership will be from the same sources as the State Health Security Board with the requirement that all Council members must be residents of the county they serve. These County Advisory Councils will work with and through the State Board and four State Divisions in more effectively implementing the planning, operation and evaluation of the Delaware Health Security Act. Funding for the Delaware Health Security Act will be as follows: . All state and federal funds available for health and health care costs in Delaware; . Employer (Employees can contribute) graduated payroll tax of from 4 percent for employers with from two to nine employees to 9 percent for businesses with 50 or more employees. This Act will reduce what employers are now paying for their employee/retiree health care; . A Health Security Tax of 2.5 percent on net taxable income for those who file individual or joint income tax returns in Delaware; . An additional Health Security Surtax on net taxable income of 2.5 percent for persons filing a Delaware income tax return in excess of $250,000. Married couples filing a joint Delaware income tax return shall pay an additional income surtax of 2.5 percent on net taxable income in excess of $500,000. The most important overall result from enacting this systemic health care reform legislation is that adequate initial and continuous funding will be available to halt the deterioration of our current health care system. Ample funds will be available to provide every citizen comprehensive health care coverage and also provide needed funds for additional health care facilities, staffing, program improvement and both pre-service and continuing education investments."}, "733": {"bill_id": 121460, "number": "SB121", "change_hash": "c60a457ef75047295b1f3b13ff3451f6", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB121/2009", "status_date": "2009-07-02", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2009-07-02", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 6, 9, 18, 19, 25, And 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Discrimination In Employment, Public Works Contracting, Housing, Equal Accommodations And The Insurance Business.", "description": "This Act adds the term &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; to the already-existing list of prohibited practices of discrimination.

The regular brakes do not have to be applied as hard or as soon and thus saves the drums and brake shoes which also saves money for the owners. If an owner normally has three brake replacements a year this system can reduce it to one to two replacements a year. This can be a potential savings of two to three thousand dollars a year. This system also costs the owner approximately $2,000.00 to $2,500.00 extra to have it installed on the vehicle at the factory. This system has a safety advantage when traveling on ice and snow and when it is activated a truck can slow down without locking up the brakes. The ban was imposed because of the noise the braking system can cause without proper mufflers; however, enforcing equipment and noise laws should suffice to curb noise violators."}, "743": {"bill_id": 121471, "number": "SB131", "change_hash": "6c9d46cc0766b859897d4514887ef5e2", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB131/2009", "status_date": "2009-06-04", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-06-09", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (COMMUNITY/COUNTY AFFAIRS) in Senate with 3 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 6 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Home Construction And Improvenment Protection.", "description": "This Bill provides for disclosure materials and information to be distributed where additional density or bonuses have been granted by the local government.

The EB program is paid 100.0% from the state&#8217;s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund for week 1 of EB since Delaware unemployment insurance law does not provide for a waiting week period and 50.0% from the state&#8217;s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund and 50.0% by the federal government for weeks 2 through 13 of EB.

However, the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act, Title II of Division B of Public Law No. 111-5, enacted February 17, 2009, provides that if a state enacts an optional EB trigger based on the TUR (total unemployment rate), all weeks of EB, except EB paid to individuals based on wages from state and local governmental entities that have elected the reimbursement option in lieu of unemployment insurance assessments pursuant to Section 3345 (7), Title 19, Delaware Code, will be paid 100.0% from federal funds through the week ending January 2, 2010. Those state and local governmental entities electing the reimbursement option in lieu of unemployment insurance assessments pursuant to Section 3345 (7), Title 19, Delaware Code must continue to pay 100.0% of the cost of such EB payments. The state &#8220;triggers&#8221; on to EB for 13 weeks with the TUR &#8220;trigger&#8221; if the total unemployment rate for the most recent 3 months equals or exceeds 6.5% and the average rate of total unemployment in the state for the most recent 3-month period equals or exceeds 110 percent of such average for either or both of the corresponding 3-month periods ending in the two preceding calendar years.

Section 3 also updates and augments the bond provisions of the SEU law to bring them into conformity with current practices related to the issuance of bonds. Section 4 of the act makes a technical correction, changing the word &#8220;Certificates&#8221; to &#8220;Credits&#8221;. Section 5 of the act clarifies that the SEU may repay bonds using proceeds from the sale of Solar Renewable Energy Credits, as well as the sale of Renewable Energy Credits. Sections 6 and 7 clarify that  360(a) and (b) of Title 26 related to renewable energy trading apply to Solar Renewable Energy Credits, in addition to Renewable Energy Credits. Under  360 of Title 26, renewable energy credits and solar renewable energy credits that are unused &#8220;shall exist for 3 years from the date created.&#8221; Section 8 amends  360 of Title 26 by adding a new subsection (c), which tolls the 3 year limit on the existence of renewable energy credits and solar renewable energy credits during any period that such a credit is held by the SEU."}, "786": {"bill_id": 121517, "number": "SB174", "change_hash": "51b23dc2b92774b5a3183fb61a141d1f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB174/2009", "status_date": "2009-07-10", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2009-07-10", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Uniformed Controlled Substances Act.", "description": "The Office of Controlled Substances is under the authority of the Department of State and handles regulatory inspections and administrative matter dealing with controlled substances.

Section 1. This amendment to the definition for &quot;cheating device&quot; broadens the scope of that definition to include cheating devices applicable to table games. The new definition includes cards or dice that have been marked, loaded or tampered with, and clarifies that cheating devices may be mechanical, electromechanical, electronic, photographic or computerized in nature. Section 2. This new definition for &quot;table game&quot; is identical to the definition utilized in Title 29, Chapter 48. Section 3. Sub-paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 1471 are amended to include table games. Sub-paragraph (c) is also amended to clarify that cheating may be done on behalf of a third party. Sub-paragraph (d) is amended to broaden the prohibition on manipulating components of a table game, and sub-paragraph (e) is amended to broaden the type of instruments that may be counterfeited to include chips and other wagering instruments. Sub-paragraphs (f) - (l) are new and are added to address specific fraudulent activity incident to table games, such as: (f) shuffle fraud, (g) falsely claiming another's winning wager, (h) dealer collusion, (i) posting wagers after the game outcome is known; (j) decreasing wagers after the game outcome is known; (k) solicitation of game fixing; and (l) use of unlawful electronic devices. Section 4. Section 4 alters the penalty structure for theft crimes. Section 1472, as it presently exists, makes all violations of this subchapter class A misdemeanors for first offenses and a class G felonies for second and subsequent offenses. The new section preserves this penalty structure for non-theft table crimes, such as possession and use of a cheating device, use of counterfeits, manipulation of game components, and use of unlawful electronic devices. However, the new section increases the penalties for theft crimes such as cheating, altering bets, dealer collusion, late posting or decreasing of wagers. The enhanced penalties for theft crimes are consistent with the penalties for theft crimes generally, and vary based on the amount of the theft. The new Section 1472 also includes a new penalty for game fixing. Section 5. Because law enforcement officers may not always be on-site to assist in the apprehension of a person committing a violation of Section 1471, this new section gives video lottery agents and their employees or agents the authority to detain patrons for questioning when they have probable cause to believe a violation of that section has occurred. It also provides civil and criminal qualified immunity to the video lottery agent for conducting questioning and detaining a suspect, and requires that law enforcement be summoned without delay and that the video lottery agent post notice of its detention authority. Section 6. Section 6 amends the definition of &quot;money laundering&quot; to including knowingly engaging in a transaction with criminal proceeds with the intent of evading currency transaction reporting requirements. Sections 7-9. Sections 7-9 address a current gap in Delaware law by prohibiting persons from structuring financial transactions or otherwise attempting to evade the filing of a currency transaction report. Section 7 defines &quot;structuring&quot; to include transactions arranged for the purpose of evading currency transaction reporting requirements, such as breaking down transactions into smaller sums or engaging in transactions over a series of days. Section 8 preserves money laundering, as it exists under current law, as a Class D felony. Section 9 creates a new prohibition against causing or attempting to cause a financial institution not to file a currency transaction report or to file a misleading currency transaction report, as well as &quot;structuring&quot; a transaction to avoid a currency transaction report. This new prohibition would be a Class G felony. Sections 10-11. Section 10 enhances the penalties for underage gaming by specifying the penalties for persons under the required age who use the lottery and creating a penalty for video lottery agents who allow underage persons to take part in lottery games. Section 11 allows underage gaming prosecutions to be heard in courts other than Superior Court."}, "801": {"bill_id": 121532, "number": "SB189", "change_hash": "cd1e28e9590a30095fb53725c398972b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB189/2009", "status_date": "2010-02-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-02-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Chapters 69 And 80 Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Energy Performance Contracting Act And The Delaware Energy Act, Respectively.", "description": "This Act amends Section 8059 of Title 29, which created Delaware&#8217;s Sustainable Energy Utility (&#8220;SEU&#8221;).

Declarations of persons abroad are routinely received in state and federal courts and agencies. Many of the declarations are affidavits and other documents sworn to by declarants before authorized officials in United States embassies and consulate offices. Affiants in foreign countries with information relevant to U.S. proceedings or transactions typically visit the U.S. consular office to finalize their affidavit or statement in a manner similar to a person within the United States visiting a notary public. In recent years, and particularly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, access to U.S. embassies and consulates has become more difficult because of closings or added security. As a result, obtaining appropriately sworn foreign declarations for court or agency use has become much more difficult in the post-9/11 environment. The goals of UUFDA are to address this situation and to harmonize state and federal law in this area. This Bill would alleviate the burden of a foreign affiant in providing important information for state proceedings, while at the same time helping to reduce congestion in U.S. consular offices and allowing U.S. consular officials to increase focus on core responsibilities. This Bill advances this goal by affirming the use in state legal proceedings of unsworn declarations made by declarants who are physically outside the boundaries of the United States when making the declaration. If an unsworn declaration is made subject to penalties for perjury and contains the information in the model form provided, then the statement may be used as an equivalent of a sworn declaration. UUFDA excludes use of unsworn declarations for depositions, oaths of office, oaths related to self-proved wills, declarations recorded related to real estate, and oaths required to be given before specified officials other than a notary. UUFDA will extend to state proceedings the same flexibility that federal courts have employed for over 30 years. Since 1976, federal law (28 U.S.C.  1746) has allowed an unsworn declaration executed outside the United States to be recognized and valid as the equivalent of a sworn affidavit if it contained an affirmation substantially in the form set forth in the federal act. Finally, UUFDA harmonizes state and federal treatment of unsworn declarations and will reduce aspects of confusion abroad regarding differences in federal and state litigation practice. This Bill also updates the state&#8217;s perjury statutes to include unsworn declarations made pursuant to UUFDA."}, "875": {"bill_id": 190659, "number": "SB263", "change_hash": "27161d5aae9dae3360ace3f92c55ad06", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB263/2009", "status_date": "2010-07-30", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-07-30", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Teacher Notice And Hearing Protections.", "description": "This Bill adds a requirement that a teacher show 2 years of satisfactory student growth within a 3 year period before the teacher may receive the highest level of notice and hearing protections."}, "876": {"bill_id": 190660, "number": "SB264", "change_hash": "eac8dc9f8b2816e393fca0f0add2858a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB264/2009", "status_date": "2010-07-12", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2010-07-12", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 10 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Disposition Of Children Pending Adjudication And Payment For Care.", "description": "For nearly 8 years Delaware has been involved in a collaborative effort among juvenile justice agencies to, among other goals, reduce the unwarranted detention of juveniles and provide meaningful alternatives to such detention. While the Juvenile Justice Collaborative has made significant strides in that effort, experience has shown that the current provisions of 10 Del. C. 1007 do not adequately meet the circumstances faced by those courts dealing with juvenile detention decisions. Situations such as violent misdemeanors-especially against parents, guardians and non-secure facility staff; escape from non-secure detention; intimidation of witnesses; and breaches of conditional release involving additional alleged delinquent acts have proven difficult to handle where secure detention is not a possible option. While this Bill would expand the list of possible acts for which a child could be detained in a secure facility, it provides significant safeguards against abuse of detention on these grounds. This Bill also requires that all other less restrictive options must be examined and considered before imposing secured detention, as is required by current law. The Bill further requires judges to put in writing any decision to use secure detention that overrides a presumptive analysis in a Risk Assessment Instrument calling for release or non-secure detention. Decisions by a Justice of the Peace to securely detain a juvenile are reviewed the next day Family Court is in session, an additional review must occur 14 days after detention and further review hearings must be held every 30 days thereafter.

Section 1 of the Act provides for an administrative review process at the conclusion of an unclaimed property examination. This review process may be invoked at the option of the holder. It will allow the holder to file a written protest, submit additional information in support of the protest and request that the Audit Manager reconsider the Department&#8217;s findings following an examination. The Audit Manager must make a written determination based on the protest and on the entire record of the examination and the materials submitted with the protest by the holder.

Section 2 of the Act creates a limited exemption from the definition of property for abandoned property purposes that arises from transactions between merchants covered by the Uniform Commercial Code where, for whatever reason, a merchant holder receives goods for which the holder was never invoiced by the seller.

No generally applicable business-to-business exemption is intended to be created by this section. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act clarify that, in accordance with established accounting and industry practice, the State may employ estimation techniques in certain circumstances in order to determine a holder&#8217;s liability for abandoned or unclaimed property. Sections 5 through 10 reduce the administrative burden of compliance by holders by reducing the number of reports to be made and eliminating the duty to hold such reports for public inspection in their headquarters. Section 11 of the Act corrects the unintended omission to include all enumerated items of property in the exception to the definition of property for purposes of the Abandoned Property Law in subdivision 1198(11) when that definition was amended in 76 Del.

Prior to its amendment, the exception had included all enumerated items in subdivision 1198(11), and the General Assembly did not intend to change that result when it amended the subdivision in 2008.

Finally, it will change the current practice of allowing persons who have been sanctioned for abuse, neglect mistreatment or financial exploitation to remain certified.

A Charter Committee, the Mayor and City Council, with participation from the public, met in numerous meetings beginning in September 2008 to reorganize and revise their charter. Most of the existing charter has remained the same though some revisions were made and the charter was reorganized. This bill is a result of that effort and the following summarizes those changes from the previous charter: A table of contents delineating the articles has been included at the outset. The Charter has been reorganized by changing the order of the articles, moving various sections to more appropriate articles and consolidating articles. The order of the articles is more logical. First, the territory and annexation procedures are set out, followed by the election process, the powers of the city, the form of government, the administration, then the financial articles involving taxing and borrowing, followed by various miscellaneous provisions. The existing Charter had two articles for the power of the city with a structure article between and a separate article for the City Manager and other administrative appointments. Those appointed offices have now been combined into one article. The election article was moved from Article IX to Article II. The most significant substantive changes are as follows: The territory of Milford shall be established by an official map recorded in the appropriate county. The wards shall be delineated by official maps recorded in the appropriate county and by metes and bounds. Annexation procedures have been developed to include state requirements. Annexation agreements are recognized and annexed property designated to contiguous Wards when annexed. In the case of a special election for annexation, property owners within the property to be annexed are limited to one vote. Presently having no vote, the Vice Mayor will now qualify as a Councilperson while acting as Mayor for the purpose of establishing a quorum. Elections have been made consistent with state law. In the event of a tie vote for an elected office, a special election for that office will be held within thirty days. The deadline to file for Office of Mayor or Council Person changes from thirty to sixty days before the election. A criminal background check will be required on all candidates running for the Office of Mayor and Council Person. Filling vacancies for Mayor or Council have been clarified. The residency requirement for Mayor has changed from thirty days to two years. The residency requirement for City Council has changed from thirty days to one year. Allows five year capital budget to be submitted with annual budget and not three months in advance. Short term borrowing not to exceed the amount of annual tax billing was clarified to include aggregate borrowing and without special election."}, "922": {"bill_id": 207139, "number": "SB313", "change_hash": "77a03c4d446276014a8f53afd2b431b8", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB313/2009", "status_date": "2010-06-17", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2010-06-23", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (COMMUNITY/COUNTY AFFAIRS) in Senate with 3 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 22 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Municipal User Tax.", "description": "This legislation is intended to address circumstances in which an employer is found to have erroneously withheld city wage taxes from an employee.

The legislation has no effect on the procedures used to award good time credit by DOC or the ability of the Commissioner to forfeit good time credit to reflect inappropriate prison behavior. The legislation will however restore the ability of inmates (other than ones serving a life sentence) to be awarded good time credit regardless of the statutory offense for which they are incarcerated subject to the limitations set forth in subparagraph (b).
