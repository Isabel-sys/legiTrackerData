The victim of the alleged assault shall be informed of their rights under the Victims&#8217; Bill of Rights in Chapter 11 as well as available confidential counseling and advocacy services. Law enforcement agencies are required to be discrete when contacting a victim and are required to inform the victim of their rights under the Victims&#8217; Bill of Rights. Exceptions to the reporting requirement are made for persons with privilege against disclosing communications, as well as sexual assault victim advocates. There is also an exception for disclosures made at student-led speak out events. Institutions will also be required to train all staff in the reporting requirement and the nature and prevalence of sexual assaults on campus, and certify compliance with the training requirement to the Office of Higher Education. Training is also required for all students regarding sexual assault and the reporting requirement, with extra training mandated for high risk student groups such as athletes, fraternities and sororities, and international students. The Department of Justice is empowered to fine academic institutions for failure to comply with the reporting requirements.

To that end, the Act requires resolution of arbitrated matters in no more than 120 days, subject to extension of up to no more than an additional 60 days, by unanimous consent of all parties to the arbitration. The Act provides significant flexibility to select an appropriate arbitrator. If the parties do not select an arbitrator, or the selected arbitrator refuses to serve, the Act truncates the process for appointing arbitrators, where necessary, ensuring a rapid and public initiation of the process in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Act vests exclusive jurisdiction to determine the scope of the arbitration to the arbitrator, thus eliminating in arbitrations under the Act the role of the Courts in determining substantive arbitrability in certain cases. Neither the joinder of persons not parties to the arbitration agreement nor the assertion of non-contractual claims deprives the arbitrator of the authority to determine what is subject to the arbitration and what is not. To further speed the ultimate resolution of disputes under the Act, it provides for a single direct challenge to the Delaware Supreme Court, where challenges are not otherwise waived by the parties&#8217; agreement, or conducted by agreement before an arbitral appellate panel. Where challenges are taken to the Delaware Supreme Court, those proceedings are public and limited to review under the standards of the Federal Arbitration Act. To ensure that no person is subject to the Act without his or her express and voluntary consent, the Act precludes its use in cases where there is a danger that vulnerable parties&#8217; rights are at stake. Thus, this Act may not be used to adjudicate controversies between business entities and consumers of their goods and services, or controversies involving persons who have not expressly agreed to arbitrate the matter at issue."}, "49": {"bill_id": 754996, "number": "HB50", "change_hash": "d9107261b3488691ed93cbe82340522b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB50/2015", "status_date": "2015-07-16", "status": 5, "last_action_date": "2016-01-14", "last_action": "Placed on the House Ready List", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Education Assessment.", "description": "This bill creates the right for the parent or guardian of a child to opt out of the annual assessment, currently the Smarter Balanced Assessment System."}, "50": {"bill_id": 755241, "number": "HB51", "change_hash": "4b1512f0d2fe13a3f120661426c5ab7a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB51/2015", "status_date": "2015-06-30", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2015-06-30", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 11 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Fines, Costs, Penalties And Forfeitures.", "description": "The Fund to Combat Violent Crimes was established by House Substitute No. 1 for House Bill No. 143 of the 146th General Assembly.

Currently, at least 11 other states (including Pennsylvania) have adopted the ABA standard. Since 2009, approximately 90 children between the ages of 7-9 have arrested and prosecuted in Delaware&#8217;s Family Court. Most of the charges brought against these children were minor, low-level misdemeanor offenses, and the vast majority of all charges against children in this age range were dismissed or otherwise terminated in favor of the child. Since 2011, there have only been 10 arrests and no adjudications of children under the age of 10 for felony conduct.  Criminal prosecutions of very young children require significant criminal justice resources, including forensic competency evaluations to determine if the child understands the nature of the proceedings and is able to participate in their defense. By adopting the ABA standard, this act would bar criminal and juvenile delinquency prosecutions of children under 10. As an alternative, such children may be required to participate in any pre arrest diversionary program administered by the Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services, and any child believed to be abused, neglected, dependent or in need of mental health services may be referred to the Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health, the Division of Family Services or any other appropriate state agency.

CDNDSC is engaged in this effort through a number of review panels that examine health related issues, medical and legal issues, accidental deaths, and incidents arising from child abuse and neglect. The latter category of cases is assigned to CDNDSC&#8217;s Child Abuse and Neglect (&#8220;CAN&#8221;) Panel.

Currently, Delaware uncharacteristically lags behind many states &#8211; including the neighboring states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland &#8211; in allowing for certain other licensed professional healthcare specialists to join with physicians in the ownership of medical professional corporations. As a &#8220;corridor state,&#8221; it has always been important that Delaware stay apprised of how our neighboring states are treating competing issues significant to our State and economy. This analysis typically confirms our renowned proactive approach, consistent with sound business practices, that attracts both commerce and people to Delaware. Rather than being at the forefront on this particular issue, however, we are currently bringing up the rear and clinging to outdated concepts that apply to professional corporations in this State for no other reason than that this chapter of the Delaware Code has received no substantive attention for over 40 years. Being &#8220;behind the curve&#8221; as we are here in relation to our neighbors is in decidedly stark contrast to our familiar role in Delaware as innovators and leaders in matters of commerce. In this case, however, the effects reach beyond pure matters of commerce and extend into the efficient delivery of healthcare in our State. Through the provisions of the Act, Delaware can achieve equality by offering designated medical providers the same professional rewards allowed by our neighboring states, and enable sound practice collaboration to also encourage the retention of first-rate medical providers within Delaware. This opportunity is presented at a time when the efficient and effective delivery of quality health care is an immediate goal all must strive to achieve. Doctors of podiatric medicine (DPMs) in particular possess sufficient similarities with other physicians &#8211; e.g., the ability to prescribe drugs and to perform types of invasive surgery &#8211; making co-ownership of practices by physicians and DPMs particularly suitable for the promotion of efficiencies in healthcare delivery. By implementing this change, the Act would also track classifications used for billing purposes under federal Medicare guidelines, which typically include DPMs along with medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy in the category of &#8220;physicians.&#8221; The proposed changes to be implemented in the Act do not apply to hospitals in the State, which are organized as not-for-profit corporations under corporate laws outside of the Act, and as such, do not have physician shareholders or a purpose of generating pecuniary profit."}, "139": {"bill_id": 777803, "number": "HB140", "change_hash": "e3642e05a30fb1c367ce12b4230a4b5f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB140/2015", "status_date": "2015-07-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2015-07-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 21 And 30 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Taxes And Fees Supporting The Transportation Trust Fund.", "description": "This bill increases several revenue sources for the Transportation Trust Fund.

Current section 4915 expressly provides that IRAs described in Internal Revenue Code  408 and Roth IRAs described in Internal Revenue Code  408A are exempt from certain creditor claims. The Act clarifies that the section 4915 exemption for IRAs and Roth IRAs applies even if the IRA or Roth IRA was inherited by the owner. The clarification is deemed advisable in light of the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Clark v. Rameker holding that a similar exemption in the federal bankruptcy laws did not apply to an inherited IRA.  Section 2 of the Act (i) creates a procedure, similar to the procedure in place in several other states including Alaska, Arkansas, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Ohio, for validating a will, while the testator is still living, against challenges predicated upon undue influence, mistake, incapacity or other grounds; and (ii) creates a similar procedure for validating the exercise of a power of appointment by an instrument other than a will. Section 3546 of title 12 provides a similar procedure for validating trusts including revocable trusts that often in effect serve as will substitutes. The public policy considerations implicated by such a statute are described in a recent article: Glen R. Kazlow et al., Ante-Mortem Probate: Why Wait Until It&#8217;s Too Late, 214 N.J.L.J. 1051 (2013);. Section 3 of the Act (i) modifies section 3312(c) (which provides generally that, when a trustee invests in an affiliated investment, the trustee must disclose the affiliated investment to the trust&#8217;s beneficiaries in order to assure that the trustee&#8217;s fees will not be reduced on account of the investment) to provide that a trustee investing in an affiliated investment at the direction of an investment adviser need not provide the disclosure generally required by section 3312(c) given that the trustee in such a case is not responsible for the investment decision; (ii) revises section 3313 to clarify the circumstances in which the statute applies and to expand the definition of &#8220;investment decisions&#8221; to encompass various actions commonly understood to be within the ambit of the term; (iii) revises section 3325(19) to clarify that provision and revises section 3325(29) (which empowers trustees to merge trusts in cases where the merger does not alter beneficial interests in either merged trust) to provide expressly that the trustee merger power is available in cases where a new trust is created for the purpose of participating in the merger, as is commonly done to in effect revise the administrative provisions of a trust; (iv) modifies section 3332 to (1) codify and expand upon the Delaware Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decision in the Peierls cases regarding when the law of Delaware governs the administration of a trust transferred to Delaware from another jurisdiction, and (2) address fiduciary liability in the context of ambiguity regarding the law governing the administration of a trust; (v) revises section 3333 to (1) provide that the attorney-client privilege is deemed to protect communications between a fiduciary and counsel in cases where counsel is retained by the fiduciary and paid by the fiduciary from the fiduciary&#8217;s own funds, and (2) clarify that the fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not apply in cases where a fiduciary retains counsel in connection with a claim against the fiduciary or in connection with a matter that might reasonably be believed to be a matter that will lead to such a claim, even if the privileged communications have the effect of guiding the fiduciary in the performance of fiduciary duties; (vi) modifies section 3338 to clarify that the interested persons, referenced in the statute, whose consents are required in order to effect a binding nonjudicial settlement agreement, are those persons whose consents or non-objections would, pursuant to Chancery Court Rule 101, be required in a Chancery Court consent proceeding; (vii) adds a new section 3340 providing a safe harbor regarding certain circumstances, among others not enumerated in the statute, in which a trust will be treated as having its place of administration in Delaware for purposes of the various statutes in title 12 applicable by their terms to such trusts; and (viii) adds a new section 3342 addressing some of the consequences of trust mergers and other similar transactions, such as so called &#8220;decanting&#8221; transactions, in which one trust succeeds to the property and rights of another trust. Section 4 of the Act (i) addresses the rules regarding court accountings for trusts under wills probated on or after April 5, 1909 in cases where the testator died on or before July 31, 2005, as the provisions of prior law regarding the topic were inadvertently omitted from a recent bill reorganizing and modifying the general rules regarding court accountings for trusts; (ii) corrects a cross-reference in section 3526 of title 12; (iii) revises Delaware&#8217;s so called decanting statute (12 Del. C.  3528) to (1) reword the statute for clarity without making any substantive change on account of the revised wording, (2) permit a trustee to appoint trust income in further trust to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as trust principal may be appointed under current law, and (3) clarify that a trustee&#8217;s statutory power to appoint trust principal and income in further trust, which can only be exercised when the trust is irrevocable, can be exercised in cases where the trust by its terms is revocable but in fact is irrevocable on account of the settlor&#8217;s incapacity; (iv) modifies section 3542 (which currently permits corporate trustees to terminate small trusts in certain circumstances) to permit trustees who are not corporations to exercise the same power subject to restrictions intended to avoid potential adverse tax consequences; (v) clarifies the notice requirement for section 3546 in a manner similar to new sections 1311 and 1312 added to the Delaware Code by Section 2 of the Act; (vi) deletes an obsolete reference to the Office of Thrift Supervision appearing in section 3570 and further revises section 3570 to permit a transferor, seeking to make a qualified disposition within the meaning of the statute, to retain a substitution power described in section 675(4)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code; and (vii) revises section 3582 to clarify that the statute is intended to address only monetary damages that a court may award for breach of trust because section 3581 deals generally with the other remedies available for breach of trust. Section 5 of the Act provides an effective date."}, "164": {"bill_id": 783914, "number": "HB165", "change_hash": "ec3db8063c5cd98e0f15e95f40d655b5", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB165/2015", "status_date": "2015-06-03", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-03-24", "last_action": "Assigned to Appropriations Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 14 And 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Family Leave.", "description": "This legislation requires that all full-time employees of the State, including employees of school districts, continuously in the employ of the state for at least one year, shall be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave upon the birth or adoption of a child 6 years of age or younger.

This bill removes the certification requirement for health care providers who are not licensed in Delaware, but licensed in another state; changes the allowable payment for these non-certified, out-of-state providers to the lesser of the usual and customary, the other state&#8217;s maximum reimbursement, Delaware&#8217;s maximum reimbursement, or a negotiated contract; and adds utilization review as a payer recourse for non-certified, out-of-state providers. This bill also allows the Workers&#8217; Compensation Oversight Panel to realize the 2016 and 2017 mandated medical cost savings in the Delaware workers&#8217; compensation system through any component of the health care payment system and not just the fee schedule. This bill also allows the Workers&#8217; Compensation Oversight Panel to create regulations pertaining to the use of electronic billing in the workers&#8217; compensation healthcare payment system."}, "166": {"bill_id": 784630, "number": "HB167", "change_hash": "95dac71d6da015764e12a4334747136f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB167/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-22", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2016-06-30", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES/ELECTIONS) in Senate with 5 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 15 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Elections.", "description": "This Act improves the enforcement mechanisms related to Delaware&#8217;s campaign finance disclosure laws in four ways.

Section 2 involves the limit on the amount of real property taxes that the Town may levy and collect. Specifically, the bill substitutes a percentage for the &#8220;hard cap&#8221; of $1,000,000.

The principal change in the Act is to remove disincentives for companies to create Delaware jobs and invest in Delaware property that currently exists in how income is apportioned to Delaware for purposes of the corporate income tax. Apportionment is the process by which multi-state firms determine what share of their total income is &#8220;assigned&#8221; to Delaware. Currently, income is apportioned to Delaware using three factors: a) property; b) payroll; and c) sales. These factors are expressed as a fraction with Delaware&#8217;s share in the numerator and the total amount in the denominator. These three equally weighted fractions are then averaged to arrive at the ultimate Delaware apportionment percentage. The use of property and payroll in this calculation is often criticized because companies that add employment or facilities in Delaware often see their Delaware apportionment rise, which ultimately results in higher Delaware corporate income taxes for such companies. Sections 7 and 8 of this Act reduce and then eliminate the disincentive to invest in property and employees in Delaware by first doubling the weight on the sales factor in tax year 2017 and then by gradually moving toward relying exclusively on the sales factor beginning in 2020. Additionally, Sections 7 and 8 clarify that corporations organized under the laws of foreign countries that do business in the United States may not dilute their property and payroll factors by including property and payroll that is located outside of the United States in the denominator of these fractions. Section 9 provides that, starting in 2017, telecommunications corporations and corporations with their worldwide headquarters located in Delaware that make capital investment in those facilities may use either single sales factors or equally weighted, three-factor apportionment. The remaining sections of the Act ease business tax compliance for Delaware employers, particularly smaller Delaware businesses. Sections 1-4, 6 and 11-21 of this Act simplify business tax compliance for smaller businesses by reducing tax payment and filing burdens. For example, the Act would double the thresholds at which businesses have to make monthly gross receipts tax and withholding filings, enabling hundreds of Delaware businesses to file quarterly instead. The Act also provides that filing thresholds and tax calculations will be indexed for inflation, which locks-in the simplification and efficiency gains for future taxpayers. Sections 5 and 10 of this Act simplify compliance for smaller business. Currently, all corporations must pay 50% of their estimated tax liability for the first quarter of their taxable year, followed by payments of 20%, 20% and 10% in each of their second through fourth quarters. This Act allows smaller businesses with receipts of less than $20 million to make use of a simpler, evenly-weighted (25% per quarter) schedule. Further, this Act updates the calculation for the penalty for underpayment of estimated tax, which has not changed in more than 30 years."}, "235": {"bill_id": 812128, "number": "HB236", "change_hash": "8db24c7afbca32ae4d6a4abcfb0af276", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB236/2015", "status_date": "2016-01-12", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-05-03", "last_action": "Assigned to Appropriations Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Tax Exemption.", "description": "This bill will allow for a school property tax exemption for a person of any age who has been designated as a disabled veteran by the U.

Typical symptoms include fatigue, fever, and headache. Without treatment, the infection can damage the joints, heart, and central nervous symptom, resulting in meningitis, temporary facial paralysis, and impaired muscle function. Newly-diagnosed patients can be treated with antibiotics. Even with treatment, many patients experience chronic symptoms. Due to the general nature of the symptoms and lack of awareness or understanding of the disease, however, many patients have experienced difficulty in receiving an accurate diagnosis and receiving appropriate treatment.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of people diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is around 300,000. Delaware, along with our neighboring states, is in the red zone for Lyme disease. In 2013, 13 states in the northeast region of the U.S. alone reported more than 94% of the confirmed cases of Lyme disease across the country; Delaware had the 6th highest incidence of those reported cases. Delaware has a greater need to understand and respond to Lyme disease than other states. The statistics show that Delaware has a heightened interest in educating its health care professionals about Lyme disease. This Act is the result of the findings of the Lyme Disease Task Force (&#8220;the Task Force&#8221;). On June 1, 2015, the Task Force issued a report that made several recommendations to address this critical health threat which is unique to Delawareans, including the creation of the Lyme Disease Education Oversight Board (&#8220;the Board&#8221;), which is tasked with the following: Educating health care professionals to develop a high index of suspicion for Lyme disease, because Delaware is in an endemic area for the disease. Educating health care professionals that Lyme disease can be diagnosed clinically based on history and physical examination, and serologic antibody testing can confirm, but is not required to make, a clinical diagnosis. Encouraging continuing medical education credits and nursing continuing education units regarding Lyme disease and make the topic enticing to encourage health care professionals to attend such courses as soon as they are available. Hosting continuing education credits and units in all three counties, making efforts to host the courses in hospitals to get the most health care professionals together at once. Delivering education in a variety of methods, using professional associations, medical journals, radio, internet, and conferences, and linking medical training with a public awareness campaign. Trying to bring all health care professionals together for collaboration. This Act includes a sunset provision and will expire 8 years after its enactment unless otherwise provided by a subsequent act of the General Assembly."}, "291": {"bill_id": 866000, "number": "HB292", "change_hash": "42231e196551922fcc0389c82f455d69", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB292/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-09", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-06-09", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Posting Information Related To Child Abuse And Neglect In Schools.", "description": "This bill requires schools to post the toll-free telephone report line number for child abuse and neglect in a conspicuous location, where it may be viewed by students.

The Office of the State Treasurer (&#8220;OST&#8221;) would remain the administrative arm for the Deferred Compensation and ABLE programs and would also become the administrative arm for the College Investment Plan program supporting the new Board. Consolidation of responsibility for the three programs under one Board would have several benefits as all plans share the same core characteristics. First, oversight would be improved for all the plans due to synergies in skill sets and knowledge brought by members to the consolidated board. Second, OST&#8217;s ability to support and administer these programs would improve as functional specialization could be spread over a greater asset base as opposed to expertise developed by program. Finally, the aggregate knowledge and diverse experience of a consolidated board would best serve Delaware in making the key decisions on the design and implementation of the newly-enacted ABLE law.

Section 1. Section 104 is amended in connection with the amendments to Sections 311, 312 and 313. Section 2. The amendment to Section 111(a)(2) permits the Court of Chancery to exercise non-exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over civil actions involving certain instruments, documents, or agreements, including (i) those to which a Delaware corporation is a party and pursuant to which one or more holders of the corporation&#8217;s stock sell or offer to sell any of such stock, and (ii) those by which a Delaware corporation agrees, subject to specified conditions, to sell, lease or exchange any of its property or assets. The amendment does not affect the concurrent subject matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court over civil actions at law involving such matters. Section 3. Section 141(b) is being amended to eliminate surplus language that addresses the minimum quorum requirement for a one-person board of directors. Section 4. Section 141(c) is being amended to specify default quorum and voting requirements for committees of a board of directors and subcommittees of committees of a board. Section 141(c)(3) is being amended to clarify that references in the General Corporation Law to board committees (and committee members) will be deemed to include references to subcommittees (and subcommittee members). Section 5. Section 141(d) is being amended to eliminate the express reference to subcommittees of committees of a board. The eliminated reference is unnecessary given the amendments to Section 141(c)(3). Section 6. The amendment to Section 158 provides that any two officers of the corporation who are authorized to do so may execute stock certificates on behalf of the corporation. The amendment is not intended to change the existing law that the signatures on a stock certificate may be the signatures of the same person, so long as each signature is made in a separate officer capacity of such person. Section 7. Section 7 amends Section 251(h) in several respects. It clarifies that Section 251(h) is applicable to a constituent corporation that has a class or series of stock that is listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger, even if not all classes or series of stock of such constituent corporation are so listed or held. Relatedly, Section 7 clarifies that the offer contemplated by paragraph (2) (the &#8220;Offer&#8221;) may be effected through separate offers for separate classes or series of stock. The amendments to Section 251(h) also clarify that the Offer may be conditioned on the tender of a minimum number or percentage of the shares of the stock of the constituent corporation, or of any class or series thereof. Section 7 permits, for purposes of determining whether the requirement in paragraph (3) (the &#8220;Statutory Minimum Tender Condition&#8221;) is satisfied, the inclusion of shares of stock of the constituent corporation held by any person that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding stock of the corporation making the Offer (the &#8220;Offeror&#8221;), or that is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of such person or persons or of the Offeror (such owners and such subsidiaries, collectively, the &#8220;Offeror Affiliates&#8221;). Section 251(h), as amended, similarly permits shares of stock of the constituent corporation that are the subject of a written agreement requiring such shares to be transferred, contributed or delivered to the Offeror or any Offeror Affiliate in exchange for stock or other equity interests in the Offeror or any Offeror Affiliate to be counted for purposes of determining satisfaction of the Statutory Minimum Tender Condition, so long as such shares are in fact so transferred, contributed or delivered prior to the effective time of the merger (such shares in fact so transferred, contributed or delivered, &#8220;Rollover Stock&#8221;). Further, Section 7 provides that Rollover Stock and shares of the constituent corporation held by such constituent corporation in treasury, by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of such constituent corporation, or by the Offer or Offeror Affiliates are excluded from the requirement that they be converted in the merger into, or into the right to receive, the same consideration paid in the Offer. Finally, Section 7 clarifies the methods by which shares of stock of the constituent corporation may be &#8220;received&#8221; for purposes of the Statutory Minimum Tender Condition. With respect to certificated shares, such shares will be &#8220;received&#8221; upon physical receipt of a stock certificate accompanied by an executed letter of transmittal so long as the certificate representing such shares was not cancelled prior to consummation of the Offer. With respect to uncertificated shares held of record by a clearing corporation as nominee, such shares will be &#8220;received&#8221; by transfer into the depository&#8217;s account by means of an agent&#8217;s message. With respect uncertificated shares not so held, such shares will be &#8220;received&#8221; by physical receipt of an executed letter of transmittal by the depository. Regardless of how uncertificated shares are held, they will cease to be &#8220;received&#8221; to the extent such uncertificated shares have been reduced or eliminated due to any sale of such shares prior to the consummation of the Offer. For purposes of the foregoing, an &#8220;agent&#8217;s message&#8221; is a message transmitted by the clearing corporation acting as nominee, received by the depository, and forming part of the book-entry confirmation, which states that such clearing corporation has received an express acknowledgment from a stockholder that such stockholder has received the Offer and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Offer, and that the Offeror may enforce such agreement against such stockholder. Section 8. The amendment to Section 262(c) is intended to clarify that where a provision of the certificate of incorporation confers appraisal rights where those rights otherwise do not exist, an appraisal proceeding must be dismissed under the new provisions of subsection (g) of Section 262, if applicable. Section 9. The amendments to Section 262(d) conform to Section 251(h) as amended. Section 10. The amendment to Section 262(g) limits the availability of a judicial determination and award of fair value where the corporation's shares had been traded on a national securities exchange. In that circumstance appraisal rights are essentially precluded unless the dispute with regard to valuation is substantial and involves little risk that the petition for appraisal will be used to achieve a settlement because of the nuisance value of discovery and other burdens of litigation. In a short-form merger under Section 253 or Section 267, however, there is no requirement of approval by the corporation's board of directors and therefore no obligation on the part of directors to approve and recommend the merger, and appraisal may be the only remedy. Accordingly, the limitation in new subsection (g) also is not applicable to mergers accomplished pursuant to Section 253 or Section 267. Section 11. The amendment to Section 262(h) provides an option to the surviving corporation to pay to the stockholders seeking appraisal a sum of money, the amount of which is to be determined in the sole discretion of the surviving corporation, at any time before judgment is entered in the appraisal proceeding, with the result of avoiding the need to pay subsequently accruing interest on that sum. There is no requirement or inference that the amount so paid by the surviving corporation is equal to, greater than, or less than the fair value of the shares to be appraised. Where one or more stockholders' entitlement to appraisal is contested in good faith, the corporation may elect to pay such amount only to those stockholders whose entitlement to appraisal is uncontested. Section 12. Section 311 is amended to include a procedure to restore a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation after it has expired by limitation. This change is consistent with Section 278 which provides that Sections 279 through 282, relating to dissolved corporations, apply to any corporation that has expired by its own limitation. Section 311 is also amended to clarify that a corporation desiring to revoke its dissolution or restore its certificate of incorporation must file all annual franchise tax reports that the corporation would have had to file if it had not dissolved or expired by limitation and pay all franchise taxes that the corporation would have had to pay if it had not dissolved or expired. Section 13. Section 312 is amended to distinguish the procedure to extend the term of a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or to restore a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation if it has expired by limitation from the procedure to revive a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation when it has become forfeited or void. Section 312, as amended, only applies to a corporation whose certificate of incorporation has become forfeited or void and now uses only the term &#8220;revival&#8221; to reflect this process. The terms &#8220;renewal&#8221;, &#8220;extension&#8221; and &#8220;restoration&#8221; have been eliminated. The amendment to Section 312, however, does not invalidate or otherwise change the effect of filings to &#8220;revive&#8221;, &#8220;renew&#8221;, &#8220;restore&#8221; or &#8220;extend&#8221; a corporation that were made pursuant to Section 312 prior to the effective time of the amendment to Section 312. The amendment to Section 312 also does not affect the procedure for a corporation formed by a special act of the General Assembly to renew, revive and continue its corporate existence. The procedure to extend a corporation&#8217;s duration is now solely governed by Section 242 which sets forth the manner in which a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation is amended, including for the purpose of changing the period of duration of the corporation. Section 311 as amended sets forth the procedure to restore a corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation that has expired by limitation. The other amendments to Section 312 clarify and simplify the procedures to be followed by a Delaware corporation to revive its certificate of incorporation which became forfeited or void. The amendments clarify that the provisions of Section 312 do not apply to a corporation whose certificate of incorporation has been forfeited or revoked by the Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 284. Amended Section 312 also clarifies and streamlines the process to approve a revival of the certificate of incorporation by providing that a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or the sole director in office, may authorize the revival of the certificate of incorporation. Further, Section 312 identifies such directors as those who, but for the certificate of incorporation having become forfeited or void, would be the duly elected or appointed directors of the corporation. The amendments also clarify the process for elections of directors if none are in office and the effect of a revival with respect to actions taken by the corporation&#8217;s directors or members of the governing body, officers, agents and stockholders or members. Section 14. The amendments to Section 313 conform to the amendments to Section 312 which provide that a corporation files a certificate of revival when its certificate of incorporation has become void or forfeited. Section 15. Section 314 is amended in connection with the amendments to Sections 311, 312 and 313. Sections 16, 17 and 18. Section 16 provides that the effective date of Sections 1, 3 through 6 and 12 through 15 is August 1, 2016. Section 17 provides that Section 2 shall be effective only with respect to instruments, documents and agreements entered into on or after August 1, 2016, and that Section 7 shall be effective only with respect to merger agreements entered into on or after August 1, 2016. Pursuant to Section 18, Sections 8 through 11 shall be effective only with respect to transactions consummated pursuant to agreements entered into on or after August 1, 2016 (or, in the case of mergers pursuant to Section 253, resolutions of the board of directors adopted on or after August 1, 2016 or, in the case of mergers pursuant to Section 267, authorizations provided on or after August 1, 2016 in accordance with an entity's (as defined in Section 267) governing documents (as defined in Section 267) and the laws of the jurisdiction under which such entity is formed or organized), and appraisal proceedings arising out of such transactions."}, "369": {"bill_id": 876409, "number": "HB372", "change_hash": "7129ceb767b286369ce9095e646b6d25", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB372/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-22", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-06-22", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Chapter 18, Title 6 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Creation, Regulation, Operation And Dissolution Of Domestic Limited Liability Companies And The Registration And Regulation Of Foreign Limited Liability Companies.", "description": "This bill continues the practice of amending periodically the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) to keep it current and to maintain its national preeminence. The following is a section-by-section review of the proposed amendments of the Act.  Section 1. This section amends  18-105 of the Act to provide a method for effecting service of legal process upon a series of a limited liability company established pursuant to  18-215(b) of the Act. Section 2. This section amends  18-215(b) of the Act to confirm and clarify two propositions. First, neither the first sentence of  18-215(b), nor any language in a limited liability company agreement or certificate of formation that is included pursuant to that first sentence, shall be construed as restricting a series, or a limited liability company on behalf of a series, from agreeing to be liable for any or all of the debts, liabilities, obligations or expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, or restricting a limited liability company from agreeing to be liable for any or all of the debts, liabilities, obligations or expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a series. Second, any reference in the Act to assets of a series includes assets associated with a series and any reference to assets associated with a series includes assets of a series. Section 3. This section amends  18-215(k) of the Act to make two changes. First, it deletes the word &quot;affirmative&quot; as unnecessary in connection with a &quot;vote.&quot; Second, it eliminates the requirement for a written consent and thereby permits the members associated with a series to consent to the specified action by means other than a writing. Section 4. This section amends  18-302(d) of the Act to confirm that the provisions of that subsection are intended to be enabling and are not intended to restrict the way in which members may vote on, consent to or approve any matter. Section 5. This section amends  18-304 of the Act to eliminate the requirement for a written consent and thereby permit the members of a limited liability company to consent to the specified actions by means other than a writing. Section 6. This section amends  18-404(d) of the Act to confirm that the provisions of that subsection are intended to be enabling and are not intended to restrict the way in which managers may vote on, consent to or approve any matter. Section 7. This section amends  18-702(a) of the Act to make two changes. First, it deletes the word &quot;affirmative&quot; as unnecessary in connection with a &quot;vote.&quot; Second, it eliminates the requirement for a written consent and thereby permits the members of a limited liability company to consent to the specified action by means other than a writing. Section 8. This section amends  18-704(a) of the Act to make four changes. First, it substitutes &quot;becomes&quot; for &quot;may become&quot; to clarify the effect of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3). Second, it deletes the word &quot;affirmative&quot; as unnecessary in connection with a &quot;vote.&quot; Third, it eliminates the requirement for a written consent and thereby permits the members of a limited liability company to consent to the specified action by means other than a writing. Fourth, it adds a new subsection (3) thereto to provide that upon a voluntary assignment, which is otherwise permitted, by the sole member of a limited liability company of all of the limited liability company interests in the limited liability company to a single assignee, the assignee is admitted as a member of the limited liability company unless otherwise provided in connection with such assignment or otherwise provided in the limited liability company agreement by a specific reference to the subsection. Section 9. This section amends  18-801 of the Act to make four changes. First, it deletes the word &quot;affirmative&quot; as unnecessary in connection with a &quot;vote.&quot; Second, it eliminates the requirement for a written consent and thereby permits the members of a limited liability company to consent to the specified action by means other than a writing. Third, it eliminates the requirement for an agreement in writing and thereby permits the personal representative of the last remaining member of a limited liability company to agree to the specified actions by means other than a writing. Fourth, it eliminates any implication regarding which events terminate the continued membership of a member of a limited liability company. Section 10. This section amends  18-806 of the Act to make three changes. First, it deletes the word &quot;affirmative&quot; as unnecessary in connection with a &quot;vote.&quot; Second, it eliminates the requirement for a written consent and thereby permits the members of a limited liability company or the personal representative of the last remaining member of a limited liability company or the assignee of all of the limited liability company interests in a limited liability company or other persons to consent to the specified actions by means other than a writing. Third, it eliminates the requirement for an agreement in writing and thereby permits the personal representative of the last remaining member of a limited liability company or the assignee of all of the limited liability company interests in a limited liability company to agree to the specified action by means other than a writing.

Currently, Article II,  5 of the Delaware Constitution requires the General Assembly to meet in Dover, unless an emergency caused by insurrection, conflagration, or epidemic diseases occurs. And, Article XVII,  1 of the Delaware Constitution provides the General Assembly with the power to enact laws providing for continuity of government following emergency situations, but only if the emergency results from an enemy attack. Section 2 of this Act extends the General Assembly&#8217;s authority under Article XVII,  1 to disasters involving terrorism, disease, accident, and other natural or man-made disasters. This would authorize the General Assembly to extend the provisions of Chapter 77 of Title 29 of the Delaware Code (relating to the emergency location of government), Chapter 17 of Title 29 (relating to emergency interim legislative succession), Chapter 78 of Title 29 (relating to interim executive succession), and Chapter 18 of Title 10 (relating to emergency interim judicial succession) to emergencies involving terrorism, disease, accident, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as those involving enemy attack. This change is consistent with the approach taken in at least four states, New York, Louisiana, Montana, and Utah, which have adopted an &#8220;all hazards&#8221; approach to continuity of government planning. In addition, Section 2 of this Act makes changes to Article XVII,  1 adopting the interpretation of this provision by the Delaware Supreme Court in Opinion of the Justices, 190 A.2d 521 (Del. 1963), so that it is clear that the General Assembly may provide for succession for those public offices that are not immediately filled by operation of the Constitution. Section 1 of this Act would harmonize Article XVII,  1 and Article II,  5 so that the emergency situations exempting the General Assembly from the requirement that it meet in Dover are similar to the emergency situations in which the General Assembly may enact laws or otherwise act to provide for the continuity of government. Finally, this Act makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the guidelines of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Specifically, lines 17 through 19 of this Act remove unnecessary legalese in and make grammatical changes to the final sentence of Article XVII,  1."}, "378": {"bill_id": 877585, "number": "HB381", "change_hash": "f4ac49a4bf2dc4f565b4dd07af255420", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB381/2015", "status_date": "2016-07-13", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-07-13", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Pre-authorization.", "description": "Patients struggle every day to receive necessary care, suffering symptoms longer than appropriate and encountering unnecessary stress factors as they engage in the complicated system of health insurance. One such factor is Pre-Authorization, a tool designed to save the money by making sure that care is necessary.

Developments submitted at different times could be assessed quite different fees, and some pay no fee at all based only on fortuitous timing of their application submission or which district or particular bus route the applicant&#8217;s project was located in. The current Assessment formula is also insensitive to the size of new dwelling units &#8211; so that an assessment for a 10,000 square foot, 6-bedroom single family home could be the same as the assessment for a 1,500 square foot, 2-bedroom townhome. Assuming some or all of the Voluntary Assessment is passed on to the purchaser of the home, there is a regressive effect whereby purchasers of lower-income housing are shouldering a proportionally higher burden.  This bill attempts to improve the process by taking into account the size of new dwellings, and making the fee standard across each school district since the advent and prevalence of school choice makes it more difficult to predict which schools will absorb potential new students. The bill ties the new school assessment to the cost of new construction in a local school district, multiplied by 0.625%. The resulting figure is then multiplied by the square footage of the new dwelling. The assessment is capped at $1,000 for an apartment, $2,000 for a townhome, and $5,000 for any other dwelling unit. Rather than a flat fee assessed at the time the plan is filed with the County, each unit will be assessed individually at the time a building permit is issued, and the assessment will be due when a Certificate of Occupancy is issued. Where the local school district has adequate capacity to absorb new students, a developer may still seek a certificate of adequate capacity from the Department of Education. Current contracts regarding the voluntary assessment fee between the Department of Education and any developer that are in place when this Act takes effect may be reevaluated and assessed pursuant to the new formula if the developer so wishes."}, "437": {"bill_id": 882560, "number": "HB440", "change_hash": "0da835d81129806faf06c87d326099dc", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB440/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-22", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-06-28", "last_action": "Amendment HA 1 - Introduced and Placed With Bill", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Charitable Gaming.", "description": "This Act requires that organizations wishing to operate charitable video lottery machines connect those machines to the central lottery computer system beginning March 31, 2017.

Finally, the legislation subjects operators of paid fantasy sports contests to a 15.5% tax on their net adjusted revenues."}, "443": {"bill_id": 883149, "number": "HB446", "change_hash": "95c26005f4f78ec2e128041bcf1da4d3", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB446/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-30", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-06-30", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (HOUSE ADMINISTRATION) in House with 5 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 5 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Loans.", "description": "This bill imposes a cap on the interest rate that may be charged for &#8220;alternative financial services&#8221; at an annual rate of interest of 100%. &#8220;Alternative financial services&#8221; is a term sometimes used for payday loans, installment loans, and other credit products generally targeted towards working class people without access to more traditional banking or credit card services. Over the years, this state and others have made various efforts to regulate the industry, to assure that it is operating fairly and in a non-predatory manner. Generally, lenders in this industry have restructured their loan products to avoid such laws and regulations. See, e.g., James v. National Financial, LLC, 132 A.3d 799, 834-838 (Del. Ch. 2016). By placing a cap on interest rate in Chapter 22, the purpose of this bill is to circumscribe the ability of short-term, sub-prime lenders to take advantage of unsophisticated borrowers &#8211; regardless of the name or structure they may give the credit products. By its terms, Chapter 22 does not apply to more traditional financial products offered by banks, credit unions, credit card companies, and the like. Traditional financial products are already extensively regulated by state and federal law, and are less amenable to abuse.  The bill also prohibits the use of automated withdrawals on short-term loans regulated by Chapter 22 for delinquency payments or accelerated default payments. It prohibits repeat attempts to make an automated withdrawal for at least 5 days after a declined payment, unless the borrower authorizes another attempt in writing. This will prevent borrowers from being charged multiple fees by their banks for overdrafts or declined withdrawals when licensees try repeatedly in a short time frame to process an automated withdrawal."}, "444": {"bill_id": 883359, "number": "HB450", "change_hash": "9f857c54983471563185f966a532e6b0", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB450/2015", "status_date": "2016-07-01", "status":

This Act provides that the constitutional amendment to Art. I, Sec. 12 of the Delaware Constitution proposed bill will: (1) retain the express declaration of a general right to have bail set in a criminal case; (2) provide that the only crimes for which bail must be withheld is (a) capital murder where the evidentiary proof is positive and presumption of the accusation great and (b) Class A or B violent felony offense and under procedures prescribed by law; and (3) ensures that one condition precedent to bail being withheld in non-capital cases must be a finding that no bail condition or combination of bail conditions other than detention will ensure the safety of another person or the community. This change alone does not allow that any person charged with a non-capital crime can be held without bail and no person could be subject to a detention hearing in a non-capital case until the General Assembly revised Chapter 21 of Title 11 of the Delaware Code and the General Assembly and Courts &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221; the circumstances and procedures under which detention without bail may occur. With this change, though, Delaware may move forward toward the type of modern bail system that has been increasingly adopted by other states through amendment of their state constitutions, when needed, and the development of statutory procedures that provide, in extreme cases, pre-trial detention without bail. Under current Delaware law, the only circumstance in which one may be detained without bail is when he or she is charged with capital murder. This Act would have no effect on bail procedures and standards in capital cases. The fact that bail can only be withheld in capital cases, however, is inconsistent with the evidence-based and informed decision-making that the General Assembly looks to adopt through the Justice Reinvestment Act. While granting of bail upon assessment of the needs of the accused and the community is always preferable, there will be that occasion where the pretrial risk assessment that informs release decisions suggests that detention is the appropriate course. A Delaware state court judge cannot order detention in such cases but only attempt to set the bail so high that a defendant cannot make it. This is the first step toward completing the pre-trial bail continuum. Any legislation subsequently enacted or court procedures adopted pursuant to this bill would have to require individualized, fact-governed decision-making by the Court regarding detention in order to pass muster under the United States and Delaware State Constitutions. This bill also requires trial to be held within 120 days for persons being held without bail on non-capital offenses unless the person requests a delay. If trial is not held within 120 days with no request for delay, the person shall be entitled to bail.

A land bank is a non-profit organization created by a political subdivision of the State, or through an intergovernmental agreement between two or more political subdivisions of the State, and would serve as the repository for vacant, abandoned and tax-delinquent properties that, left unaddressed, can contribute to crime, depress the local real estate market, and deplete the tax base of Delaware&#8217;s communities. A land bank would have the authority to obtain such properties at sheriff&#8217;s sales instituted by the jurisdiction that established the land bank, where such properties have been abandoned by their owners because of unpaid property taxes or substantial liens arising from property code violations. The land bank would have the ability to do one or more of the following: (1) purchase liens from the local jurisdiction; (2) acquire properties at a sheriff&#8217;s sale on credit from the local jurisdiction; (3) assert a trump bid at a sheriff&#8217;s sale that would allow the land bank to acquire abandoned properties for the price of the outstanding liens. The land bank would retain the acquired properties until such time as a suitable and vetted buyer could be found who would be able to return the property to productive use. Funding for land banks created under this Act would come from governmental and private grants, private investments and property sale proceeds. Additionally, any land bank created under this Act could, at the election of the local jurisdiction, be funded through the allocation to the land bank of 50% of the real property taxes on the property for a 5 year period once the property returns to productive use or such other funding sources established by the local jurisdiction.

First, the bill prohibits the operator of an Internet service directed to children from marketing or advertising on its Internet service certain products or services deemed harmful to children. When the marketing or advertising on an Internet service directed to children is provided by an advertising service, the operator of the Internet service is required to provide notice to the advertising service, after which time the prohibition on marketing and advertising the specified products or services applies to the advertising service directly. The bill also prohibits an operator of an Internet service who has actual knowledge that a child is using the Internet service from using the child&#8217;s personally identifiable information to market or advertise the specified products or services to the child, and also prohibits such an operator from disclosing a child&#8217;s personally identifiable information if that operator has actual knowledge that the child&#8217;s personally identifiable information will be used for the purpose of marketing or advertising a specified product or service to the child. Second, the bill requires the operator of an Internet service to make its privacy policy conspicuously available on its Internet service if the Internet service collects personally identifiable information from Delaware residents for commercial purposes, and it requires the operator to comply with that privacy policy. The bill directs the Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice to promulgate rules and regulations identifying the information required to be disclosed in privacy policies, and making publicly available specific language for privacy policies that will serve as a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for operators, and states that any such rules and regulations must give primary consideration to the need to promote uniformity of the law among other states with respect to privacy policy requirements. Third, this bill protects the personal information of users of digital book services and technologies by prohibiting a commercial entity which provides a book service to the public from disclosing personal information regarding users of the book service to law enforcement entities, governmental entities, or other persons, except under specified circumstances. Among other things, the bill allows immediate disclosure of a user&#8217;s book service information to law enforcement entities when there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury requiring disclosure of the book service information, and requires a book service provider to preserve a user&#8217;s book service information for a specified period of time when requested to do so by a law enforcement entity. The bill also requires a book service provider to prepare and post online an annual report on its disclosures of personal information, unless exempted from doing so. The bill gives the Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice the authority to investigate and prosecute violations of the acts. This bill becomes effective January 1 following its enactment into law. The Act is substituted for Senate Bill No. 68 and differs from Senate Bill No. 68 by (1) revising proposed new  1204C(a) to clarify that the restrictions on marketing or advertising applicable to an operator of an Internet service directed to children apply only to the operator&#8217;s Internet service directed to children and not to other Internet services the operator may have which are not directed to children; (2) revising proposed new  1204C(b) to clarify that the intent of this subsection is that the restrictions on advertising to a child contained in the subsection apply when the operator has actual knowledge as to which specific user of the Internet service is the child; (3) revises proposed  1204C(d) to clarify the obligations of an operator of an Internet website, online service, online application, or mobile application directed to children where marketing or advertising is provided by an advertising service; (4) deleting firearms training courses and BB guns from the list of products and services to which the marketing and advertising restrictions apply; (5) replacing &quot;sexually-oriented material&quot; on the list of products and services to which the marketing and advertising restrictions apply with a definition based on the definition of material &quot;harmful to minors&quot; in Delaware's obscenity statute; (6) adding a new subsection to proposed  1204C to clarify that the marketing and advertising restrictions do not apply to the incidental placement of products or services embedded in content, such as in movie clips or television shows, as long as the content was not distributed primarily for the purposes of marketing and advertising a prohibited product or service; (7) replacing proposed  1205(b) with a new subsection directing the Consumer Protection Unit of the Department of Justice to promulgate rules and regulations identifying the information required to be disclosed in privacy policies, and making publicly available specific language for privacy policies that will serve as a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for operators, and states that any such rules and regulations must give primary consideration to the need to promote uniformity of the law among other states with respect to privacy policy requirements; (8) revising proposed  1206C(a) to clarify the circumstances under which a book service provider may disclose a user's book service information to a person that is not a government entity; and (9) revising, adding, or deleting certain definitions."}, "658": {"bill_id": 774036, "number": "SB69", "change_hash": "f558569d1048524dc5f3741eb9eed641", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB69/2015", "status_date": "2015-07-30", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2015-07-30", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Registration And Control Of Off-highway Vehicles.", "description": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Registration And Control Of Off-highway Vehicles."}, "659": {"bill_id": 774054, "number": "SB70", "change_hash": "d40e8bb87613e260eb471ffa5e2d64a5", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB70/2015", "status_date": "2015-07-15", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2015-07-15", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Authorize And Approve The Transfer Of Property From The Appoquinimink School District To The Town Of Townsend.", "description": "This bill provides for the transfer of property from the Appoquinimink School District to the Town of Townsend."}, "660": {"bill_id": 775409, "number": "SB71", "change_hash": "386f68cb5e7897f6b0687d93c35a687e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB71/2015", "status_date": "2015-06-17", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2015-06-23", "last_action": "Roll Call Rescinded in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Creating The &quot;life Insurance Fraud Protection Act.&quot;", "description": "This bill only applies to life insurance carriers who meet certain criteria suggesting a history of issuing fraudulent policies or other financial misconduct. When a covered insurance carrier cancels a life insurance policy for lack of insurable interest they are required to return any premiums paid on the policy to the owner of the life insurance policy so long as the owner did not engage in any wrongdoing related to the issuance of the insurance contract.  The bill also advances three goals that are important to Delaware consumers. First, it provides necessary certainty to investors who purchase life insurance policies in the secondary market. That market, in turn, benefits Delaware consumers&#8212;particularly senior citizens&#8212;by giving them the chance to sell a life insurance policy that they no longer want or need for a substantially higher price than the cash surrender value of the policy. Second, the bill eliminates the undesirable effect of incentivizing insurance companies to cancel policies as late as possible as they continue to collect premiums at no actual risk. Third, the bill eliminates the risk of expensive and unnecessary litigation for owners of life insurance policies issued in this State by establishing a clear and unambiguous rule that is consistent with existing case law."}, "661": {"bill_id": 774903, "number": "SB72", "change_hash": "a4343b26697c0931163d392eb649e94c", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB72/2015", "status_date": "2015-04-28", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2015-05-06", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (EDUCATION) in Senate with 5 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Secretary Of Education's Qualifications.", "description": "This bill increases the teaching and administrative experience qualifications for the Secretary of Education from 5 years to 10 years.

Today, this network continues as a combination of both separate school programs and within local school district support services. In addition, the code designates a Statewide Director who primarily has provided direction, training, and technical assistance within the DAP. However, current practices in special education, especially regarding inclusive education and parents&#8217; desire to have their children educated within their local communities, seem to be incongruent with this older model of service delivery. In addition, the magnitude of the increase in students identified with ASD has clearly created difficulty for the Statewide Director to provide the level of services/support that once was offered.  Therefore, the recommended code changes also revise the concept of DAP toward a system in which the Statewide Director would work in collaboration with a team of experts to provide technical assistance and training to districts and educational entities. This recommendation reconstitutes the regulations to neutralize the distinction between DAP approved programs and other in-district options, thereby, allowing and providing adequate resources to serve on behalf of all student with ASD in Delaware. The number of technical/ training experts has been identified as one expert per 100 students statewide. It is suggested that the fiscal mechanism to support these changes should be through mandated district participation that is congruent with the current needs based funding system in Delaware. Lastly, the current mandatory committee structure is enhanced to include a Parent Advisory Committee, in addition to the Peer Review Committee and Statewide Monitoring Review board. These changes include articulation of the qualifications and duties of the Statewide Director for Students with ASD; the addition of a technical assistance team of educational autism specialists numbering a ratio of 1 for every 100 students (currently estimated at 15 positions); and the further clarification / additions to the committee structure for family input, monitoring, and protections under human rights. This recommendation recognizes and supports the need for specialized technical assistance and training staff to be available to build capacity for teachers in all districts and other programs educating students with ASD. These changes essentially expand available supports so that excellent, evidence-based training and technical assistance can be made available to all Delaware schools and the students within them."}, "682": {"bill_id": 778507, "number": "SB93", "change_hash": "94ed42cf0225e080beaebea4bc8e7e5b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB93/2015", "status_date": "2016-09-14", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-09-14", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Related To Creating An Interagency Committee On Autism And The Delaware Network For Excellence In Autism.", "description": "This bill establishes an Interagency Committee on Autism and the Delaware Network for Excellence in Autism.

The regulatory flexibility analysis requires agencies to consider specific methods of reducing the burdens of a proposed regulation on individuals and small businesses. The regulatory impact statement improves transparency by, among other things, requiring agencies to describe the purpose of the proposed regulation; to identify the individuals and small businesses subject to it; and to provide an estimate of the potential costs of complying with the proposed regulation.

The Act further improves transparency by requiring the Registrar to transmit the above information to the appropriate standing committee of the General Assembly. In addition, it expands the definition of &#8220;small business&#8221; to include any enterprise that employs fewer than 50 people and has gross receipts of less than $10 million.

In each RFA, an agency must consider, where applicable, lawful, feasible and desirable, specific methods of reducing the burdens of the regulation on individuals and/or small businesses, including: (1) establishing less stringent requirements and deadlines; (2) establishing performance standards to replace design standards; (3) exempting individuals and small businesses from all or part of the regulation; and (4) examining other ways to accomplish the regulation&#8217;s purpose, while minimizing the impact upon individuals and/or small businesses.  In addition, the Act provides that no proposed regulatory change may be published in the Register of Regulations unless the proposing agency submits an RFA (if applicable) and any other required information to the Registrar. The Act also amends the Administrative Procedures Act (&#8220;APA&#8221;) to specifically require agencies to submit RFAs to the Registrar for publication. Both of these provisions are important steps to enhance accountability in Delaware&#8217;s regulatory process. The Act also requires the adoption of Guidelines, which must be submitted for final publication by November 15, 2015, to assist agencies in fulfilling their obligations under the Act. Finally, the Act expands the definition of &#8220;small business&#8221; for purposes of the chapter of the Delaware Code relating to regulatory flexibility (Title 29, Chapter 104).

Section 1 eliminates language that the Delaware Supreme Court struck down in Hughes v. State, 653 A.2d 241 (1994) for equal protection and due process violations. Section 2 through 7 makes the description of sex offenses and sex offenders in Chapter 5 of Title 11 consistent with the most complete list in  4121(a)(4) of Title 11; adds  1112B of Title 11, promoting sexual solicitation of a child, to those provisions defining the offense of &#8220;dangerous crime against a child&#8221; and &#8220;sex offender unlawful conduct toward a child&#8221;; clarifies the definition of &#8220;child&#8221;; and adds the child abuse misdemeanor to those offenses that if done in sight or hearing of a related child qualifies as endangering the welfare of a child. Section 8 adds the following offenses often targeting children to those considered by Chapter 35 of Title 11 to warrant the admissibility of out-of-court statements by child victims under 11 years old regarding acts constituting such offense: Human Trafficking, Dealing in Children, Violation of Privacy, Promoting Prostitution of a Person less than 18 years old, Promoting Prostitution of a Person Less than 16 years old, and Obscenity to a Person less than 18 years old. The offenses currently addressed by Chapter 35 of Title 11 are: Unlawful Imprisonment in the First Degree, Kidnapping in the First and Second Degrees, Endangering the Welfare of a Child, Sexual Exploitation of a Child, Dealing in Child Pornography, Possession of Child Pornography, and Sexual Solicitation of a Child. Section 9 clarifies the offenses that require community notification of a sex offender and that, for this purpose, an adjudication for such an offense has the same consequence as conviction; makes a technical correction referencing the appropriate subsection under which one would be designated a sex offender; and describes rather than references the elements of a kidnapping offense that qualify the offender for a Tier III sex offender status. Section 10 adds Child Abuse in the First, Second, and Third Degrees and Promoting Sexual Solicitation of a Child to the crimes listed in the Victims&#8217; Bill of Rights and makes a technical correction to Sexual Solicitation of a Child in the same list.

Sixteen states have enacted legislation to create health care claims databases which are generally referred to as an &#8220;All Payer Claims Database&#8221; or a &#8220;Multi Payer Claims Database&#8221;.  In short, this Act will help Delaware answer the following questions: (1) How much does Delaware spend on health care? (2) How much does a service cost at a specific facility? (3) How have health care prices changed over time? (4) Are Delaware&#8217;s efforts to establish value-based alternatives to the traditional &#8220;fee for service&#8221; health care system effective? The Delaware Health Care Claims Database will help advance the ongoing work to transform the State&#8217;s health care system from a fee-for-service system to a value-based system that rewards health care providers for quality and efficiency of care. To complete that transformation, health care providers and other health care entities accepting financial risk for a population must have an appropriate level of access to health care claims data&#8212;particularly data that provides some transparency into health care pricing. Centralized and standardized access to claims data is also critical to maximizing population health initiatives, including the study of occurrences of injury or illness across the continuum of care in Delaware or in specific neighborhoods. This Act sets forth the basic structure and parameters of the Health Care Claims Database, subject to further guidance to be set forth in rules and regulations to be promulgated by the DHIN, in continued consultation with the Department of Health and Social Services, the Health Care Commission, and stakeholders in the health care community. Specific Requirements for Claims Data Reporting This Act requires certain types of claims data defined as &#8220;required claims data&#8221; to be reported by the entities specified as &#8220;mandatory reporting entities&#8221; in the Act. The Act only mandates reporting of claims data for the Medicaid Program, the State Group Health Insurance Program, and any qualified health plan in the Delaware Health Insurance Marketplace for plan year 2017 and any subsequent plan year. This Act also authorizes health insurers and providers who are not required to participate in the Health Care Claims Database to voluntarily report &#8220;claims data&#8221; pursuant to appropriate data submission and use agreements between the voluntary reporting entity and the DHIN. In both mandatory and voluntary claims data reporting, the Delaware Health Care Claims Database will maintain the privacy and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information in accordance with all federal and state privacy and security laws, including compliance with guidance found in Statement 6 of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Enforcement Policy regarding the exchange of price and cost information, and with appropriate limits on the disclosure of potentially proprietary contracted unit price information. In order to comply with a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, the mandatory reporting requirements of this Act do not apply to self-insured commercial health plans that are regulated pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Delaware Health Care Claims Database will be administered and operated by the DHIN Board of Directors, whose membership consists of a broad coalition of health care stakeholder representatives, including representatives of hospitals, physicians, providers, insurers, the business community, and government officials. This Act authorizes the DHIN Board, or a subcommittee established by the DHIN Board to administer the APCD, to review a request for claims data to determine if the requesting party or entity should have access to the requested claims data for a legitimate purpose in accordance with the goals of the statute. The determination by the DHIN Board shall be made in accordance with its bylaws, including those pertaining to conflict of interest recusal, and is not subject to appeal or to any other private right of action. This Act is revenue-neutral; it will be funded with grant money and other independent funding sources to be identified by the DHIN, in accordance with the DHIN&#8217;s existing statutory authority."}, "828": {"bill_id": 875827, "number": "SB239", "change_hash": "7b620c8e20e8d5e86755657d1dd7d093", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB239/2015", "status_date": "2016-05-03", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-05-03", "last_action": "Assigned to Education Committee in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Lawful Authority Of Teachers Over Pupils.", "description": "According to data provided by the Delaware Department of Education (&#8220;DOE&#8221;), thousands of Delaware students receive out-of-school suspensions each year for minor infractions, such as being unprepared or late for class, dress code violations, and disrespectful behavior. In 2013, only 2% of out-of-school suspensions were for serious offenses such as weapons, drugs, or serious violence. Out-of-school suspensions do not address the root causes for the misbehavior, and only serve to put the students further behind in class. Furthermore, DOE data shows that, in 2013, African-American students made up only 32% of the student body, but accounted for 62% of out-of-school suspension, and students with disabilities made up 13% of the student body, but accounted for 24% of out-of-school suspensions.  Delaware, like many states around the U.S., is part of a disturbing trend known as the &#8220;school to prison pipeline.&#8221; New federal discipline guidance, developed jointly by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice, instruct schools to commit to regular evaluation of school discipline policies and practices, and monitor progress toward the schools&#8217; climate and discipline goals. This process requires schools to first collect and publicly report disaggregated student discipline data, and solicit feedback from students, staff, families, and community representatives. This Act furthers those goals by replacing out-of-school suspensions with more effective and restorative interventions, and require school districts and charter schools that suspend defined numbers of students or suspensions disparities to take meaningful corrective action by implementing restorative justice practices and smart discipline advisory committees. The schools in need of intervention are defined schools with high rates of suspension in the following categories: (1) All students. (2) Students belonging to 1 or more subgroups, such as students of specified racial subgroups or with disabilities. (3) Schools with a significant disparity in suspension rates between racial subgroups or between students with disabilities and students without disabilities. This Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the guidelines of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual.

The following is a section-by-section review of the proposed amendments of the Act.  Section 1. This section amends  3801(g) of the Act to provide that a statutory trust may opt out of separate legal entity status if provided in the certificate of trust and the governing instrument of such statutory trust. Section 2. This section amends  3804(a) of the Act to confirm and clarify two propositions. First, neither the fourth sentence of  3804(a) nor any language in a governing instrument or certificate of trust that is included pursuant to that fourth sentence shall be construed as restricting a statutory trust on behalf of a series from agreeing to be liable for any or all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof, or restricting a statutory trust from agreeing to be liable for any or all of the debts, liabilities, obligations or expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a series. Second, any reference to assets of a series includes assets associated with a series and any reference to assets associated with a series includes assets of a series. The final sentence amends  3804(a) of the Act to confirm and clarify that a statutory trust which has established series may take specified actions in the name of such series unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument. Section 3. This section amends  3806(i) of the Act to confirm and clarify that if so stated in the governing instrument of a statutory trust, the delegation by a trustee to one or more other persons of such trustee&#8217;s rights and powers to manage and control the business and affairs of the statutory trust can be made irrevocable. Section 4. This section amends  3806 of the Act to add a new subsection which provides that trustees of statutory trusts registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act will have the same fiduciary duties as directors of private corporations for profit organized under the general corporation law of the State unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument. This amendment codifies, with respect to such trustees, the historical Delaware rule that generally affords the protection of the business judgment rule to the conduct and decisions of the board (or other manager) of a Delaware business entity. The amendment does not imply that such protection is inapplicable to trustees or other persons of statutory trusts that are not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act. Section 5. This section amends  3808(c) of the Act to modify and provide additional means by which a dissolution of a statutory trust may be revoked. Section 6. This section amends  3810(a) of the Act to provide that a statutory trust may opt out of separate legal entity status if provided in the certificate of trust and the governing instrument of such statutory trust; and to confirm and clarify that the formation of a statutory trust is not invalid as a result of the sequence in which the certificate of trust is filed and the governing instrument is adopted by the statutory trust. Section 7. This section amends  3811(d) of the Act to provide for the manner in which a proxy relating to a statutory trust may be made irrevocable under the governing instrument. Section 8. This section amends  3813 of the Act to limit the form of copies of public records to be supplied by the Secretary of State upon request and payment of fees under this section to photocopies or electronic images. Section 9. This section amends  3819 of the Act to confirm that a beneficial owner and a trustee of a statutory trust may make a books and records request in person or by attorney or other agent. Section 10. This section provides that the proposed amendments of the Act shall become effective August 1, 2016."}, "833": {"bill_id": 882492, "number": "SB245", "change_hash": "3b2ab51502224d8873504e2db64e0a9a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB245/2015", "status_date": "2016-09-06", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-09-06", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Establishment Of A Behavioral And Mental Health Commission.", "description": "This Act adopts the recommendation of the Behavioral and Mental Health Task Force, established in 2015 by Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 29, to establish a Behavioral and Mental Health Commission to provide oversight and monitoring of the provision of behavioral and mental healthcare in this State.

In 1983, the timeframe for the Governor to make an appointment when the State Senate was not in session was lengthened to 60 days, a timeframe for the Governor to make an appointment when the State Senate was in session was added and set at 60 days, and a provision permitting judges to hold over in office for 60 days after their term expired was added. Since 1897, the number of constitutional courts and the number of judges on those courts has increased. As a result, the Governor must now call special sessions of the State Senate for the consideration of judicial nominees more frequently than in the past.This Act provides more flexibility to the Governor and State Senate in two respects. First, it extends the 60 day period after the occurrence of a vacancy to a 90 day period. The 90 day period strikes a balance between the need to have judicial positions filled quickly to avoid operational disruptions in the court system and the desire to have more flexibility when the General Assembly is not in session. Second, the Act clarifies that the Governor and State Senate may consider a nomination 30 days prior to the occurrence of the vacancy. The Constitution was previously silent on the consideration of nominations prior to the occurrence of a vacancy.This Act also modifies the time period during which an incumbent judicial officer whose term has expired may hold over in office after the expiration of his or her term from 60 days to 90 days to match the vacancy timeframes. This Act confirms that an incumbent judge whose term has expired has the option to hold over in office for that 90 day period, but is not required to do so. Finally, this Act makes additional technical corrections to conform existing law on lines 4 through 6, line 8, lines 18 through 20, and line 22 to the guidelines of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}, "861": {"bill_id": 881811, "number": "SB276", "change_hash": "fbcd448221a55f0e94e5234bd42a6dd1", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB276/2015", "status_date": "2016-07-13", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2016-07-13", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 6 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Uniform Commercial Code.", "description": "Effective on August 1, 2016, this Act adds &#8220;statutory trust&#8221; to the definition of &#8220;person&#8221; for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code."}, "862": {"bill_id": 881813, "number": "SB277", "change_hash": "888033c77603512faf0fa2b2d04ceb21", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB277/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-14", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2016-06-21", "last_action": "Amendment SA 1 - Introduced and Placed With the Bill in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Workforce Development.", "description": "This bill establishes a permanent steering committee for the Pathways to Prosperity initiative, in order to ensure the long term sustainability and adaptability of the program.

In 2011, the Uniform Law Conference of Canada approved an act to provide for recognition of foreign protection orders, including those from the United States.In 2015, the Uniform Law Commission approved an act to provide for recognition by the States of Canadian domestic-violence protection orders, called the Uniform Recognition and Enforcement of Canadian Domestic-Violence Protection Orders Act (URECDVPOA). In large part, URECDVPOA is based on UIEDVPOA. However, URECDVPOA is designed specifically with international issues in mind, so it recognizes and enforces only the portion of Canadian domestic-violence protection orders restricting contact between parties to the order and deals only with the civil Canadian domestic-violence protection orders. Section 1 of this Act adopts URECDVPOA as part of Delaware law. As a result of the adoption of URECDVPOA, all of the following are provided for:(1) A law-enforcement officer is, upon a finding of probable cause that a valid Canadian domestic-violence protection order has been violated, authorized to enforce the no-contact provisions of the order as if it were an order issued by the Family Court of this State.(2) The Family Court may enforce the no-contact provisions of a valid Canadian domestic-violence protection order. However, the Court may not enforce the order if the court finds that due process has been violated, that is, if an individual did not receive notice and the opportunity to be heard by the issuing Canadian court.(3) An individual may register a Canadian domestic-violence protection order in this State by filing a certified copy of the order with the Family Court.  (4) The State and a state agency, local governmental agency, law-enforcement officer, prosecuting attorney, clerk of the court, or state or local governmental officials acting in an official capacity and in good faith are immune from civil and criminal liability for an act or omission arising out of this Act. Section 2 of this Act is a conforming amendment to an existing Delaware Code provision, the crime of Criminal Contempt of a Domestic Violence Protective Order ( 1271A of Title 11). This conforming amendment makes it a crime to violate a Canadian domestic-violence protection order in this State. This conforming amendment also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the guidelines of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual."}, "871": {"bill_id": 882724, "number": "SB286", "change_hash": "eeb847228c40d0284ca86c65f9f4d2ec", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB286/2015", "status_date": "2016-06-30", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2016-06-30", "last_action": "Passed by Senate.

Of that amount, approximately $5 million is paid directly to the operators of county and municipal police pension funds.

When the United States was first formed and the thirteen states selected their first governors, nine were of Scottish ancestry. All the members of the first American cabinet had Scottish ancestry. Delaware&#8217;s first governor, John McKinly, was born in Northern Ireland of Scottish descent. Americans of Scottish descent have played a vibrant and influential role in the development of this country. However, not until 1997 was this influence recognized by a single-year U.S. Senate Resolution that appeared in the Congressional Record of April 7, 1997. In 1998 National Tartan Day was officially recognized on a permanent basis when the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 155 recognizing April 6th as National Tartan Day. This was followed by companion bill House Resolution 41 which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 9, 2005. President George W. Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation on April 4, 2008 making April 6 National Tartan Day. In April of 2008, then Governor Minner issued a statement celebrating the accomplishments of Scots-Irish Americans in the First State as part of a Scots/Scots-Irish Heritage Month. April 6 commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which asserted Scotland's sovereignty over English territorial claims, and which was a significant influence on the American Declaration of Independence. Canada has been celebrating &quot;National Tartan Day&quot; since 1993. The idea and motivation for creating a similar American holiday was provided by the Scottish Coalition, a group of national Scottish- American cultural organizations.
