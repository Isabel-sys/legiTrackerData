In their place, this Act creates three main drug crimes &#8211; Drug Dealing (that is, delivery or manufacture, or possession with intent to deliver or manufacture); Aggravated Possession (that is, possession of amounts generally indicative of drug dealing but where drug dealing need not be proved); and Possession. Each of the crimes would have multiple levels of seriousness depending upon a number of aggravating factors, which would include proximity to a school or a park, presence in a vehicle, prior record, reaching a threshold weight of drugs, involvement of children in the offense, or resisting arrest with force or violence. None of the crimes would equate &#8216;possession&#8217; and &#8216;possession with intent to deliver&#8217; as do the present Possession within 1000 Feet of a School, Possession within 300 Feet of a Park, and Maintaining a Dwelling or Vehicle. Section-by-Section Analysis of Substantive Revisions: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14, 23, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 44, 45, 65, 67, 68, and 69, of the Act make technical and conforming changes to the law. Sections 5 and 6. These sections create a new subsection (a)(9) to  1448 of Title 11, which would create a class F felony for a person who possesses a handgun or semi-automatic or automatic firearm at the same time as the person possesses a controlled substance. Sections 8, 9 and 10. Certain felonies are defined in the Criminal Code as &#8216;violent felonies.&#8217; The new drug dealing and aggravated possession statutes are included as &#8216;violent felonies.&#8217; Convictions under the former statutes that counted as &#8216;violent felonies&#8217; will continue to count as &#8216;violent felonies,&#8217; except that statutes in which &#8216;simple possession&#8217; of a controlled substance could count as a &#8216;violent felony&#8217;&#8211; present  4754A (possession and delivery of a non-controlled prescription drug), 4767 (possession within 1000 feet of a school), and 4768 (possession within 300 feet of a park) -- would be repealed. Sections 11 and 12. The drug crimes that would make for subsection (b) &#8216;habitual criminal&#8217; eligibility pursuant to  4214(b) of Title 11 would include  4752, 4753, 4754, and 4755, and would roughly correspond to the statutes that establish eligibility under the present law. Sections 15 to 19. The boot camp provisions are modified so that a drug conviction ( 6703) will not be an absolute prohibition against DOC placing a convicted inmate in a boot camp program. They are also modified so that First Offender boot camp diversion ( 6712) is available to charged defendants on roughly the same basis as at present. Section 20. This section directs the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission to develop sentencing guidelines for cases involving controlled substances significantly exceeding the minimums required for new  4752 of Title 16. It is anticipated that this could be completed by the effective date of this Act. Section 21. The definition of anabolic steroids in  4701(5) is changed to be consistent with the definition set forth in  4718(f) of Title 16. Section 22. The definition of &#8216;controlled substance&#8217; is expanded to include &#8216;designer drugs.&#8217; Under present law, because &#8220;designer drugs&#8221; were not included in the definition of &#8216;controlled substance,&#8217; Trafficking in designer drugs was prohibited, but Delivery, Manufacture, and Possession were not. Section 24. The provision (16 Del. C.  4753A(a)(8)b) that excepted certain designer drugs from being prohibited is moved to the definitional section. Section 25. This section defines &#8216;dose,&#8217; which is currently undefined. Section 27. The definition of &#8216;Lawful Prescription or Order&#8217; is added at the request of the Board of Pharmacy. The definitions of &#8216;licensed practitioner,&#8217; &#8216;patient-practitioner relationship,&#8217; &#8216;prescription drug,&#8217; and &#8216;prescription drug order,&#8217; in the Safe Internet Pharmacy Act subchapter, at  4743, are moved to the definitional section ( 4701(24), (31), (37), and (38)) so that the terms could be used not only in the Internet Pharmacy Act but throughout chapter 47. Section 27. The aggravating factor &#8216;Protected Park or Recreation Area&#8217; is modified from the present Possession within 300 Feet of a Park or a Place of Worship. This section continues to provide for a protective zone around parks and recreation areas, designed to protect children. It becomes an aggravating factor. The protective zone around places of worship, as it is less focused on the protection of children, is eliminated if the place of worship does not have a school or recreation area. Section 27. The aggravating factor &#8216;Protected School Zone&#8217; is modified from the present Possession within 1000 Feet of a School to be limited to within 300 feet. This is the distance used in the Possession within 300 Feet of a Park statute. The reason the size of the protective zone is reduced is that &#8220;1000 Feet&#8221; creates too large of a protected zone for the zone to act as a deterrent to drug dealing near schools. Section 27. The definition of &#8216;Purported Controlled Substance&#8217; is derived from existing  4752A&#8217;s prohibition against &#8216;unlawful delivery of a noncontrolled substance&#8217; upon the representation that the substance being delivered is a controlled substance. Section 32. This section repeals 16 Del. C.  4751. Under  4751(a) &amp; (b), Delivery of a Narcotic Drug is currently a class C felony if the narcotic drug is Schedule I or II (as are cocaine, heroin, and oxycodone), and a class E felony if the narcotic drug is Schedule III, IV, or V. This Act would make Delivery illegal under  4752, 4753, and 4754, where it would be a class B, C, or D felony, depending upon the weight of the drugs, and the presence or absence of aggravating factors. Section 4751(c) &#8211; Delivery Causing Death -- which has been charged once in the last four years, would be repealed. When facts giving rise to such a charge occur in the future, the case could be charged as Delivery and, if appropriate, Criminally Negligent Homicide. Even if there were no homicide charge available, the Court could take the death into account in sentencing on the Delivery. Section 4751(d), which provides for mandatory minimum sentences of 6 and 12 years for &#8220;nonaddicts&#8221; convicted of  4751, and which is not used, would be repealed. Section 33. The section sets forth five aggravating factors &#8211; (1) Protected School Zone; (2) Protected Park Zone; (3) Vehicle; (4) Juvenile Co-conspirator; and (5) Resisting Arrest Force or Violence. The first four are modified from present drug law. The fifth is new. It is based on the idea that a drug defendant who resists arrest with force or violence represents a more serious societal problem than one who does not. While resisting arrest with force or violence is already a crime (11 Del. C.  1257(a)), it is a class G felony, which will generally have no sentencing consequences when paired with a drug felony. The aggravating factor is designed to address the drug defendant who fights the law enforcement officer making an arrest, and the drug defendant who flees in a vehicle at high speeds. A person could be convicted of both a drug offense with this aggravating factor and a separate charge of  1257. The State will need to charge any aggravating factor, and will need to prove the aggravating factor as an element of the offense. Since the aggravating factors for a protected school zone and for a protected park or recreation area are similar in intent, if they are both present in the same case, they would be counted as one aggravating factor rather than two. Section 34. This section addresses prior qualifying drug convictions, which would be used to enhance sentences. The definition of a prior qualifying Title 16 conviction includes the main Delaware felony drug offenses, and equivalent offenses from other jurisdictions. For the offense to count as an enhancement, there is a &#8216;recency&#8217; requirement of five years, which is measured in the same way as in other Delaware statutes, such as robbery 1st or possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. For misdemeanor charges, a prior qualifying drug conviction includes prior drug misdemeanors, again with the &#8216;recency&#8217; requirement. When the defendant has a prior qualifying drug conviction, the new drug crime&#8217;s seriousness will be raised in a manner similar to the effect of an &#8216;Aggravating Factor.&#8217; A prior qualifying drug conviction will not need to be charged. Instead, it will, if contested, need to be proved at sentencing. This section also defines &#8216;two prior qualifying Title 16 convictions&#8217; so that the first conviction would have to occur and be sentenced before the offense that generates the second conviction occurs. Drug sales often involve teenage defendants, and it is not unusual for a drug dealer to have a juvenile adjudication. If a defendant has a juvenile adjudication for drug conduct occurring after he or she turned 16, the adjudication was within ten years of the present offense, and it would count as a &#8216;qualifying conviction&#8217; if committed by an adult, then it would count as the first of the two &#8216;convictions&#8217; that would give a person &#8216;two prior qualifying Title 16 convictions.&#8217; Section 35. This section creates Tier Weights for various drugs. Most of the drugs have five tier weights. As the tier weights increase, the potential penalties increase. The &#8216;Tier 2&#8217; weights are generally consistent with the minimum trafficking weights of current law. The tier weights for &#8220;narcotic Schedule II or III controlled substances that are a prescription drug&#8221; is new. Prescription drugs are dangerous. The Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office reports that in 2008, there were 125 overdose deaths from prescription drugs, more than half the total of all drug overdose deaths in the State. This Act identifies a substantial prescription drug dealer primarily by the number of pills in the dealer&#8217;s possession. Section 36. In part, this section continues present law, that is, when the weight of the drugs is an element of the offense, the State does not have to prove the defendant had any knowledge of the weight. In part, this provision creates new law, that is, when a &#8216;Tier weight&#8217; is being established by the number of substantially identical pills present, the State makes out a prima facie case upon proof that one such substantially identical pill contained the alleged controlled substance. The defendant would be free to seek an order to have additional pills tested at the defendant&#8217;s expense. Section 37. This section repeals 16 Del. C.  4752. Under  4752, Delivery of a non-narcotic drug is a Class E felony. Under the proposal, Delivery would be prohibited under  4752, 4753, and 4754, and would be a class B, C, or D felony, depending upon the weight of the drugs, and the presence or absence of aggravating factors. Existing  4752(b) &amp; (c) makes prescription or delivery or administration of anabolic steroids for enhancing human athletic performance a class E felony. It appears to target medical professionals, athletic trainers, and dealers. This Act treats dealers in anabolic steroids the same as dealers in other drugs. For the medical professionals and trainers, the prohibition against prescription or administration of anabolic steroids for the purpose of enhancing human athletic performance would be moved (by Section 51) to  4756(a)(7), where it would be a class F felony. Section 37. This section also repeals 16 Del. C.  4752A, Unlawful Delivery of noncontrolled substance. By Section 55, this Act enacts a new 16 Del. C.  4758, which would take the place of  4752A. Individuals illegally sell both street and prescription drugs. Other individuals sell counterfeit drugs (fake drugs [that may or may not contain a controlled substance] that look like prescription drugs) or &#8216;beat&#8217; drugs (fake drugs that may pass for street drugs). Under present law, delivery of counterfeit drugs is included within  4751 &amp; 4752 and carries the same penalties as the sale of the actual drugs, but delivery of &#8220;beat&#8221; drugs is prohibited by  4752A, and while carrying the same penalties as the sale of the actual drugs, is a class D felony, notwithstanding that the sale of the real drug could be a class C or E felony. The new  4758 combines the prohibition against the delivery of counterfeit and &#8216;beat&#8217; drugs in one statute, and makes the penalty the same for each, that is, a class E felony, one grade less than delivery of the real drug. Sections 38, 40, 42, 47 and 54. These sections enact the new laws against Drug Dealing and Aggravated Possession -- 16 Del. C.  4752, 4753, 4754, 4755 &amp; 4756. The structure of these new laws would be pyramidal, where each lower grade of the offense would be a &#8216;lesser-included offense&#8217; of one or more of the higher grades of the offense. Section 4752 defines the offenses that are class B felonies, for which the sentence would be &#8216;not less than 2 years up to 25 years to be served at Level V.&#8217; 11 Del. C.  4205(a)(2). The first-time offender who has what would be the minimum amount of drugs required for a trafficking conviction under today&#8217;s laws, with no other aggravating factors, would not face a minimum-mandatory sentence, as he or she would under the trafficking law. Such an offender, however, is relatively rare among trafficking defendants. The Aggravated Possession offenses only apply to street drugs. This Act recognizes that people addicted to prescription drugs may obtain prescription drugs (legally or illegally) and hoard them in significant quantities, which is not a common practice for users of street drugs. Thus, the Aggravated Possession felonies only apply to street drugs, since, if applied to prescription drugs, they might well result in an unacceptably large percentage of the cases being charged against addicts who are going to use the prescription drugs themselves. Sections 39 and 41. These sections repeal 16 Del. C.  4753 &amp; 4754. Sections 58 and 61 enact 16 Del. C.  4763 &amp; 4764. Present law makes unlawful possession of a narcotic controlled substance a class A misdemeanor, and unlawful possession of a non-narcotic controlled substance a class B misdemeanor. The new  4763 combines both laws, and makes the simplest form of unlawful possession a class B misdemeanor. Where there is an aggravating factor, including a prior possession of drugs conviction within five years of the offense, the unlawful possession offense would become a class A misdemeanor. The only controlled substance not covered by  4763 would be marijuana, the possession of which is prohibited by the new  4764. It would have a lesser penalty structure than  4763, but with adult jurisdiction for the offenses in the Court of Common Pleas, as is the case under present law. Section 39. This section also repeals 16 Del. C.  4753A -- the trafficking laws, which date from thirty years ago. The trafficking laws are the most serious drug offenses under Delaware law, but there is no requirement that the State prove that the defendant has the intent to deliver, and thus some portion of the public and the federal government regard these statutes as &#8216;possession&#8217; laws that unfairly target drug users. For example, under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, a Delaware Delivery, or Possession with Intent to Deliver, conviction is considered to be &#8216;a controlled substances offense&#8217; that results in a significantly higher sentencing guideline for a repeat drug offender or a gun offender, but Trafficking is not so considered. Thus, in many cases, a federal defendant who has been convicted of Trafficking is going to get a significantly shorter sentence than an otherwise similar defendant who has been convicted under Delaware law of Delivery or Possession with Intent to Deliver. This Act would, in effect, replace Trafficking with Aggravated Possession (as set forth in  4752(c), (d) &amp; (e), 4753(c), (d) &amp; (e), 4754(b) &amp; (c), 4755, and 4756), which would be lesser offenses than Drug Dealing offenses with the same weight of drugs. Section 41. This section repeals 16 Del. C.  4754A, Illegal Possession and Delivery of Non-Controlled Prescription Drugs. Section 57 enacts 16 Del. C.  4761, which would address the same conduct. There are presently some prescription drugs that are not controlled substances, but which are abused, e.g., &#8216;soma&#8217; and &#8216;tramadol.&#8217; These drugs may in due course become controlled substances, but other drugs will likely be developed, not be controlled substances, and will also be abused. Thus, the new statute replaces a presently-existing one, and both are designed to prohibit the illegal possession or delivery of non-controlled prescription drugs. The proposed statute adjusts the penalties downward, recognizing that the statute is addressing prescription drugs that by definition have not been classified as controlled substances. Section 43. This section repeals Possession of Controlled Substance within 300 feet of a Park. The present statute is a class G felony, is frequently charged, and there are frequent convictions under it. In 2008, it was charged in 583 cases, and was the most serious charge in 82 of them. It is, however, poorly constructed to enhance the protection of children. If a drug dealer is not deterred by the more serious laws he or she is violating, the dealer also is not going to be deterred by this less serious law. Making &#8216;a protected park or recreation area&#8217; an aggravating factor for drug offenses should be a more effective method of encouraging drug dealers and drug users to avoid parks or recreation areas than having a separate statute. Section 46. This section repeals Maintaining a Dwelling or Vehicle. Section 56 enacts a new statute for people with control of a dwelling or business who permit others to use it for drug dealing. Maintaining a Dwelling or Vehicle is a frequently charged statute. In 2008, it was charged in 2046 cases, and was the most serious charge in 416 of them. The present law is broad enough to make the possession of a marijuana joint or a single bag of heroin in a home or a car a class F felony. If the defendant has a shotgun or a hunting rifle near the joint or the bag, the defendant can also be charged with the three year minimum-mandatory Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony. Repeal of Maintaining a Dwelling or Vehicle would make &#8216;simple possession&#8217; amounts of drugs in a home or a car a misdemeanor rather than a felony. The present law traces back to a misdemeanor enacted in 1935. It appears that the original impetus for the law was to make it a crime to operate an &#8216;opium den&#8217; or the equivalent. In the modern day, this would be equivalent of criminalizing the operation of a &#8216;crack house&#8217; or a &#8216;stash house.&#8217; This Act maintains that distinction. The person who operated the drug house should be able to be prosecuted for Drug Dealing under  4752 through 4756. If there were a person who controlled the property and was knowingly complicit in another&#8217;s drug business, the property controller would be liable under the statute enacted by section 56 --  4760 &#8211; Maintaining a Drug Property. Sections 48 and 49. Sections 48 and 49 allow, for most drug crimes, a single defendant to be charged with the highest grade of offense applicable to the defendant&#8217;s crime. No other drug dealing, aggravated possession, or simple possession crimes would be charged. The intent is to give the Court the ability to charge the jury (or to consider, if the Court is the fact-finder), within constitutional limits, any lesser grade offense supported by evidence introduced at trial. If there were a conspiracy or a weapon or a drug paraphernalia charge, those charges would be additional. Section 50. This provides for the repeal of the unclassified misdemeanor in 16 Del. C.  4757(c) of Possession of a Hypodermic Syringe without Having a Doctor&#8217;s Certificate in Possession. A hypodermic syringe can be drug paraphernalia, depending upon the circumstances. When a hypodermic needle is drug paraphernalia, it will remain prohibited by virtue of 16 Del. C.  4771 &amp; 4774. Sections 51, 52, and 53. Section 51 amends &#8216;Miscellaneous Drug Crimes&#8217; to combine subsections (a)(3) &amp; (a)(7) of  4756, which had substantial overlap, into new subsection (a)(3). No substantive change is intended. New subsection (a)(7) was added, and is derived from the anabolic steroids provisions of existing  4752. [See Synopsis to section 37.]. The section deletes robbery and burglary from  (a)(6), on the theory that robbery and burglary already have their own crimes, which would apply perfectly well to robbery or burglary of drugs. On the other hand, theft depends upon the dollar value of the items stolen, and thus keeping a separate theft of a controlled substance as a felony offense is appropriate. Section 53 adds new subsection (c), which would make it a crime to solicit, direct, hire, employ, or otherwise use one or more other persons three or more times within a 30 day period to obtain prescription drugs by fraudulent means or theft. This crime would cover one person used three times; one person used two times and a second person used once; or three persons each used once. This crime would essentially target the prescription drug kingpin, who stays behind the scenes while sending an associate or associates to try to fill fraudulent prescriptions. Section 55. This section repeals Keeping Drugs in Original Container. The Department of Justice decided in 2008 that the law as written was un-prosecutable. The law states that if a person has been prescribed a prescription drug, the person must keep it in its original container. If the person does not, it is a class A misdemeanor. However, if the person has a prescription, that is a defense to the charge. Section 55 also enacts a new  4758, which is discussed in the Synopsis to section 37. Section 56. This section repeals 16 Del. C.  4760, which is unnecessary, since 11 Del. C.  209 places the same limitations on the State&#8217;s ability to prosecute a drug crime already prosecuted by another state or the United States. Section 56 also enacts a new  4760, which is discussed in the Synopsis to section 46. Section 57. This section repeals Distribution to persons under 21 years of age and Purchase of Drugs from Minors. The statutes were charged five times during the last three years, and none of the cases involved the minimum-mandatory provisions of the statutes. The likely reason that they are not charged is that they substantially overlap with the Delivery statutes, and, in the one regard that they do not overlap, conviction is nearly impossible without having a 15 year-old or younger drug user or drug dealer testifying as a State&#8217;s witness. For the rare cases where proof of the involvement of a juvenile is feasible, that would now be covered as an &#8216;aggravating factor.&#8217; Section 57 also enacts new  4761, which is discussed in the Synopsis to section 41. Section 58. This section repeals 16 Del. C.  4763. Subsections (a)(1), (b), and (d) of  4763 are either unnecessary, or superfluous in light of other provisions of this Act. Subsection (a)(2) provides for mandatory minimum terms for defendants convicted of Delivery who have a prior Delivery or Trafficking conviction. Repeat drug dealers are good candidates for incarceration, and repeal of this statute gives the judiciary greater discretion to identify which defendants should be incarcerated and for how long. Thus, (1) one recent prior drug felony conviction will be the equivalent of an aggravating factor, subjecting a repeat offender to a higher grade of offense; and (2) two recent prior drug felony convictions will be the basis for a new Drug Dealing charge being a class B felony in all circumstances. Subsection (c) of  4763 is never charged. The new law enacted by section 58 is discussed in the Synopsis to sections 39 and 41. Section 59. This section repeals Possession of Controlled Substance within 1,000 feet of a School. The present law is a class G felony, is frequently charged, and there are frequent convictions under it. In 2008, it was charged in 458 cases, and was the lead charge in 68 of them. It is, however, poorly constructed to enhance the protection of children. It is not a deterrent to a drug dealer, who, if he or she is not deterred by the more serious laws he or she is violating, is not going to be deterred by this less serious law. In addition, the signs stating &#8216;drug free school zone&#8217; are usually posted on school property and not around the border of the &#8216;bubble.&#8217; There is no actual notice being given to drug dealers that might cause them to be less likely to deal near a school. Section 60. There is no substantive change to the First Offenders Controlled Substances Diversion Program. Section 61. This section enacts  4764, which is discussed in the Synopsis to sections 39 and 41. Sections 62 and 63. These sections delete the lengthy recitation about what constitutes drug paraphernalia, which is also set forth in  4701(17). There is no substantive change. Section 64. In keeping with the penalties for possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia is re-graded from a class A misdemeanor to a class B misdemeanor. Section 70. This section changes the current system for revocation of driver&#8217;s licenses for convicted drug defendants. The current system is that a misdemeanor conviction results in a 2 year suspension, and a felony conviction results in a 3 year suspension. There was no evidence that a potential drug offender is deterred by the threat of having a driver&#8217;s license suspended. On the other hand, the lengthy suspensions, which could easily exceed the amount of time the defendant is under criminal justice supervision, are counterproductive to the defendants&#8217; attempts to become productive citizens, as it is hard to look for, or get, a job without a driver&#8217;s license. Delaware has the harshest laws in the country in regard to the length of suspension. Federal law requires a minimum of a six months suspension unless the Governor submits to the Secretary of Transportation a written certification that the Governor is opposed to such a law and the Governor certifies that the Legislature has adopted a resolution expressing its opposition to such a law. Twenty-three states, not including Delaware, have done this. Thus, the section provides for the federally-required minimum of a 6 months suspension. Section 72. This Act shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the fifth full month after the Act is enacted into law. If, for example, this Act was enacted on January 15, 2011, it would take effect at 12:01 a.m. on June 1, 2011. It will take a minimum of three months to make all the necessary adjustments that would be required to implement the changes made by these revisions to the drug laws."}, "19": {"bill_id": 243280, "number": "HB20", "change_hash": "4dbdc3e7a4add08695c97819cf9e61fb", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB20/2011", "status_date": "2011-01-25", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2011-01-25", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to Judiciary Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 10 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Personal Actions.", "description": "This legislation limits damages awarded pursuant to  8145, Title 10, Delaware Code to $250,000.00"}, "21": {"bill_id": 243282, "number": "HB22", "change_hash": "bd7ba0e87e188e10801b776eb57acd76", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB22/2011", "status_date": "2011-05-10", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-05-10", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 25 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Abandoned Property", "description": "This Bill amends the format in which abandoned personal property is defined to make it simpler to read and adds a provision that the language used in the forms of applications, notices and declarations should be simple and non-technical.

This Act does not alter or narrow eligibility for parole, nor does it limit the procedural rights or remedies available to parolees. In addition, victims will have the same right of notice and opportunity to be heard as they currently have with respect to Board of Parole hearings. Under the Truth in Sentencing (TIS) Act, the parole system was abolished for offenses committed after June 30, 1990. As a result, the caseload of the Board of Parole has decreased dramatically over the past two decades in its core areas of responsibility. As of November 2010, there were only 247 inmates in state prisons eligible for parole and 350 parolees under parole supervision. These numbers equate to approximately 5% of total incarcerated sentenced inmates and 2% of total offenders supervised in the community. Under this Act, the Board of Parole&#8217;s authority to conduct parole and conditional release hearings will be transferred to the IRCB. In addition, the Board currently has the authority to determine whether an individual has violated the terms of his or her parole, and what sanctions to impose. Under this Act, the Department of Correction will hold a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe a violation exists.

The legislation also requires agencies to review regulations for impacts on small businesses every five years and extends from 30 to 60 days the period for which judicial review of a final agency order with respect to a regulation is available. The legislation directs the Registrar of Regulations, Department of State and Office of Management and Budget to develop and publish guidelines to be used by State agencies in preparing the analysis and impact study required by the Act. The guidelines will ensure that agencies utilize a consistent reporting template for the regulatory flexibility analysis and economic impact study required by the Act and also will clarify exemptions under the Act for certain regulations such as regulations related to professional qualifications and federally mandated regulations already subject to the federal Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Section 1 also requires that plaintiffs pay a court-determined mediation fee in foreclosure actions for which mediation will occur; this fee is to be set by the court in an amount to defray the costs of the mediation program. Section 2 sets out certain requirements for the filing of a complaint or summons in a mortgage foreclosure action, including that the filing be accompanied by certain documentation related to the notices.

", "description": "SYNOPSIS Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill establish a fixed cost share effective July 1, 2012 for the different health insurance plans offered by the State for regular officers or employees of the State and their dependents, and a fixed cost share for pensioners and their dependents who are not eligible for federal Medicare. For the basic health care insurance plan, as set forth in Section 5203 of Title 29, the State will pay 96% of the total cost of the plan. For the Consumer-Directed Health plan, the State will pay 95% of the total cost of the plan. The State will pay 93.5% of the total cost of the HMO plan, and the State will pay 86.75% of the total cost of the PPO plan. The expected rate impact to eligible employees effective July 1, 2012 based on 2011 rates is as follows: This Bill eliminates the offer of a free plan, and as a result, a single employee in the State&#8217;s basic plan would now be paying approximately $20.58 per month, and an eligible employee enrolled in the family plan will be paying $53.23 per month. There are currently only 447 active employees and 132 retirees enrolled in the State&#8217;s basic plan. A single employee who is enrolled in the Blue Cross HMO Basic plan will be paying approximately $11.85 more per month, and a family in that same plan will be paying approximately $5.39 more per month. A single employee who is enrolled in the Aetna HMO plan will be paying approximately $12.26 more per month, and a family in that same plan will be paying approximately $9.42 more per month. Finally, a single employee who is enrolled in the PPO plan will be paying approximately $4.94 more per month, and a family in that same plan will be paying approximately $8.81 more per month. Section 3 of the Bill would require pensioners who retire after July 1, 2012 and who become eligible for Medicare to pay 5% of the Medicare supplement offered by the State. For each Medicare-eligible retiree or dependent who receives the Medicare supplement, the expected cost impact is approximately $20 per month. Section 4 of the Bill would change the number of years it takes for employees hired after January 1, 2007 to vest for the State share of retiree healthcare. Under current law, State employees vest for 50% of the State share at 10 years of service, 75% of the State share at 15 years of service, and 100% of the State share at 20 years of service. Pursuant to this Bill, employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2007 would vest for 50% of the State share at 15 years, 75% of the State share at 17.5 years of service, and 100% of the State share at 20 years of service. Section 5 of the Bill would eliminate double state share for new hires who are employed after December 31, 2011 as well as for current employees who become benefit eligible, and legally married after December 31, 2011. In addition, Section 5 establishes a $25 per month charge for current employees who are Double State Share eligible, effective July 1, 2012. Section 6 of the Bill would delete the reference to the &#8220;Standard 80&#8221; health care plan offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield, as the reference to the &#8220;Standard 80 plan&#8221; is an antiquated reference that is not indicative of the plan features provided for in the State&#8217;s basic health care plan. In addition, Section 6 would establish a floor of coverage the State will provide as mandated by federal law. Section 7 of the Bill would also delete an antiquated reference to the &#8220;Delaware 65&#8221; plan, which is no longer indicative of the supplemental Medicare coverage offered by the State. Section 8 of the Bill declares the intent of the General Assembly to prevent the limited abuse of the State Employee&#8217;s Pension Plan when employees voluntarily work overtime in order to inflate their final pension calculation. In addition, this Section recognizes that to protect the health and safety of employees and the citizens they serve, Agency management should also reasonably limit the assignment of mandatory overtime. This Section would require every Cabinet Secretary in each of the Executive Branch Agencies to devise a written policy by June 30, 2012 that would reasonably limit the use of mandatory and voluntary overtime. Section 9 of the Bill would redefine &#8220;final average compensation&#8221; such that for employees hired on or after January 1, 2012 overtime payments will no longer be included in the definition of &#8220;final average compensation&#8221;. Section 10 of the Bill differentiates employees for purposes of applying the State&#8217;s pension benefits: individuals first employed by the State before January 1, 2012, and individuals first employed by the State on or after January 1, 2012, who will be called &#8220;Post-2011 employees&#8221;. Section 11 of the Bill would change the normal retirement age for employees hired on or after January 1, 2012. Under current law, employees are eligible to retire at age 62 with five years of service, at age 60 with 15 years of service, or at any age with 30 years of service. Pursuant to this Bill, Post-2011 employees would be eligible to retire at age 65 with 10 years of service, at age 60 with 20 years of service, and at any age with 30 years of service. This Section would also increase the early retirement reduction factor for employees who retire prior to the normal retirement age as set forth above. Under current law, at age 55 and 15 years of service an employee may retire early, but the employee&#8217;s pension would be reduced by 2/10th of a percent for each month the employee is under the age of 60. Pursuant to this Bill, the employee&#8217;s pension would be reduced by 4/10th of a percent for each month the employee is under the age of 60.

(6) The permissible range for filing fees payable for securities registrations and notice filings is amended to establish a minimum payment of $500.00 and a maximum payment of $1,500.00.

(9) The Act is amended to make it unlawful for persons registered under the Act (or persons who are required to be registered under the Act) to make false or misleading filings with the Commissioner, to engage in any dishonest or unethical conduct, or to fail reasonably to supervise persons for whom he or she has supervisory responsibilities.

The basic philosophy of this act is one of compromise and balancing the competing interests of employers and employees. Thus, although covered employees are granted an expanded substantive right to &#8220;good cause&#8221; protections against termination, available remedies are limited to reinstatement, with or without backpay, and severance pay when reinstatement is unfeasible. Compensatory and punitive damages are eliminated, except in cases where an employer retaliates against an individual for filing a complaint, giving testimony or otherwise participating in proceedings under this Subchapter. Pursuant to this act, employees who have worked for an employer for more than one year may only be fired for &#8220;good cause.&#8221; Part-time employees working less than 20 hours per week are not covered by the act. As to covered employees, this act extinguishes all common law rights and remedies against an employer. This act, however, does not displace or extinguish any rights granted to an employee under any federal or Delaware statutes, administrative rules or regulations having the force of law. Similarly, this act does not displace or extinguish any rights granted to an employee under a collective-bargaining agreement or an express oral or written agreement relating to employment. Employees not covered by the provisions of this act retain all common law rights and remedies. This act does not apply to the State or its subdivisions or agencies, municipal corporations or private employers with less than five employees. &#8220;Good cause&#8221; for a termination is defined as: (i) a &#8220;reasonable basis&#8221; related to an individual employee in view of factors such as conduct on the job, job performance and employment record; or (ii) the exercise of business judgment in good faith by the employer. The requirement of good cause for a termination does not apply to a termination which occurs at the expiration of express term of employment or upon completion of the specified task or project to which the employment related. The provisions of this act cannot be waived except by an express written agreement of the employer and employee providing for severance pay in the event the employee is terminated without good cause. Any covered employee whose employment is terminated may file a complaint and demand for arbitration with the Department of Labor within 180 days of the effective date of the termination. An employer seeking a declaration that good cause exists for a termination may also file a complaint and request for arbitration. Arbitration pursuant to this act shall be governed by Delaware&#8217;s Uniform Arbitration Act. Either party to an arbitration proceeding may appeal the arbitrator&#8217;s award to the Superior Court of the County in which the termination occurred. The act will take effect 180 days after enactment to allow the Department of Labor to promulgate regulations implementing this act."}, "89": {"bill_id": 312242, "number": "HB90", "change_hash": "be7ec753e7899e21f212f747bdd1d90c", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB90/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-28", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-06-28", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Nonrenewal Of Contracts And Dismissal Of Department Of Education Employees.", "description": "This Act amends the contract nonrenewal procedures and hearing procedures for Department of Education employees.

", "description": "The primary purpose of this Act is to provide a party (a contractor, a subcontractor or a material supplier) with the right to file a legal action against a contractor or an owner who has improperly withheld the payment of money to force settlement or for other reasons unrelated to a lawful dispute. Often the value of these claims and the cost of litigation do not justify filing litigation. Moreover, the current statute is often unclear and confusing, which has resulted in difficulties for the Courts in applying the statute and overseeing the related litigation. The Act further seeks to provide clear language that will allow parties to pursue claims under the statute and recover an amount equal to the amount wrongfully withheld plus attorneys fees, if it is determined that the contractor or owner withheld payment in bad faith. Additionally, this Act seeks to expand the applicability of the Chapter to encompass various construction services offered on present day projects which may not have been offered when the Chapter was originally enacted. In sum, the revisions to the Chapter are primarily focused on three areas: (1) applying the Chapter to all services provided on construction projects; (2) coordinating the various sections so they work cohesively, making such sections easier to apply; and (3) addressing relevant issues that the Courts have historically struggled with in applying the statute. In particular, the revisions to current Chapter 35, Title 6, on a section by section, basis are as follows: First, existing Section 3501 was amended to cover relationships between contracting parties in three categories: (1) demolition, erection, construction, completion, addition or repair of any building or structure; (2) improvements to land; and (3) other construction services. The current version of the statute covered only the first category. Section 3503 amends the existing statute by combining the contract clauses in current  3506 and 3507 into one section. This section also seeks to harmonize the timing of events under the two sections, which are currently inconsistent. This section also adds a clause in section (d)(5) that makes it against public policy to require any agreement to be subject to laws of any State other than Delaware or to require any legal action, arbitration, mediation or other resolution procedure to take place outside the State of Delaware. Finally, the title was changed from &#8220;Payments to Contractor&#8221; to &#8220;Contract Terms&#8221; to reflect the combination of the two sections. Prior Section 3502, now embodied in Section 3504, was amended to reflect the three categories of projects covered by the Act. Prior Section 3503, now embodied in  3505, was amended to reflect the three categories of projects covered by the Act. Prior Section 3504, now embodied in  3506, was amended to reflect the three categories of projects covered by the Act and reference the correct new sections of the Act. New Section 3507 embodies former sections 3506 and 3507. In addition, the first subsection was revised to allow a contractor or subcontractor 15 days to dispute an invoice and thereby avoid the situation where the invoice is designated as accepted. This is a more reasonable timeline for all types of construction projects than the current 7 days. Prior Section 3508 was revised to clarify when attorneys&#8217; fees and litigation costs could be awarded, the standard to award such fees, and to exclude attorneys&#8217; fees from the limitation provided for in 10 Del. C.  3912."}, "109": {"bill_id": 333439, "number": "HB110", "change_hash": "6c173912d88b47c5459a6ffecc991338", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB110/2011", "status_date": "2011-05-26", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2011-05-26", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to House Administration Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Prevailing Wage Requirements.", "description": "This bill raises the dollar thresholds for public works projects subject to the prevailing wage requirement to $350,000 for new construction and $100,000 for alteration, repair, renovation, rehabilitation, demolition or reconstruction."}, "110": {"bill_id": 329390, "number": "HB111", "change_hash": "d6c38b3db40a882210a0e4a160b75230", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB111/2011", "status_date": "2012-06-15", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-06-15", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 6 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Antitrust Actions.", "description": "This Act strengthens the Office of the Attorney General&#8217;s ability to work collectively with the federal agencies and other state attorneys general in multi-state investigations by extending the statute of limitations for bringing antitrust actions from 3 to 4 years.

Section 2 of the Bill confirms that a certificate filed under Chapter 38 may be made effective at a date or time later than its filing as specified in the certificate; however, for filings made on or after January 1, 2012, the effective date or time cannot be later than the 180th day after the filing date of the certificate. Section 3 of the Bill amends  3812 by adding a new subsection (g) to provide that there is no need to amend a certificate of trust or other document on file before August 1, 2011 in order to comply with new  3807(h), but that any certificate or other document filed on or after August 1, 2011 and changing the address of a trustee or registered agent or office must comply with new  3807(h). Section 4 of the Bill provides that a registered agent filing a certificate under new  3807(f) shall pay a fee in the amount of $200, and a registered agent filing a certificate under new  3807(g) shall pay a fee in the amount of $2.00 for each statutory trust whose registered agent has resigned by such certificate. Section 5 of the Bill amends  3814(a) to provide that a domestic statutory trust may not register under a name that is not such as to distinguish it upon the records of the Secretary of State from the name of another domestic statutory trust unless the domestic statutory trust is registered as of July 31, 2011 and has obtained the consent of the other domestic statutory trust. Section 5 of the Bill further amends  3814(a) to clarify that a domestic statutory trust may register under the same name as a foreign statutory trust registered under the laws of this State, regardless of when the domestic statutory trust is registered, as long as the foreign statutory trust consents in writing to the use of its name and the consent is filed with the Secretary of State. Section 6 of the Bill provides that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the governing instrument of the statutory trust, an agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with  3815(a) may (i) effect an amendment to the governing instrument of the statutory trust, or (ii) effect the adoption of a new governing instrument to the statutory trust if the statutory trust is the surviving or resulting statutory trust in the merger or consolidation. Section 7 of the Bill clarifies that the filing of a certificate of conversion to statutory trust and the filing of a certificate of trust--both of which are required to be filed with the Secretary of State in order to convert another entity to a statutory trust--must be filed simultaneously with the Secretary of State. Likewise, to the extent such certificates are to have post-filing dates or times, the certificates must provide for the same effective date or time. Section 8 of the Bill clarifies that the filing of a certificate of statutory trust domestication and the filing of a certificate of trust--both of which are required to be filed with the Secretary of State in order to domesticate a non-United States entity as a Delaware statutory trust--must be filed simultaneously with the Secretary of State. Likewise, to the extent such certificates are to have post-filing dates or times, the certificates must provide for the same effective date or time. Section 9 of the Bill amends  3862 to provide that (i) a registered agent filing a certificate under  3854(c) shall pay a fee in the amount of $200, (ii) a registered agent filing a certificate under  3854(d) shall pay a fee in the amount of $200, and (iii) a registered agent filing a certificate under  3854(e) shall pay a fee in the amount of $2.00 for each statutory trust whose registered agent has resigned by such certificate."}, "116": {"bill_id": 330016, "number": "HB117", "change_hash": "d3476a78d3ee8d684e3e0b602c5dbbe4", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB117/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-07", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2011-06-08", "last_action": "Assigned to Judiciary Committee in Senate", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 10 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Power Of The Family Court.", "description": "This bill will give the Family Court certain powers over the parents or legal guardians of minor children who are the subject of a delinquency action in Family Court.

This Act remedies confusion that exists as a result of the current statutory construction of  1203(a) and  1203(b), Title 12 which, when read literally, arguably would allow certain property to be interpreted as &#8220;property&#8221; for purposes of both  1203(a) and  1203(b), Title 12. More to the point, in certain cases, a legal argument can be made that  1203(a) and  1203(b) apply contemporaneously to the same set of facts. This amendment eliminates such a nonsensical result by making clear that subsections (a) and (b) are mutually-exclusive, whereby the application of subsection (a) is to the exclusion of subsection (b), and vice versa."}, "133": {"bill_id": 333434, "number": "HB134", "change_hash": "b4ed154675582ba8b34a45d94c5f020f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB134/2011", "status_date": "2012-01-30", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-01-30", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 21 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Penalties For Certain Motor Vehicle Offenses.

Section 1019 provides that expunged records may be made available to law enforcement investigating criminal activity or where a person has applied for a job in law enforcement or to determine if a person is eligible to participate in a First Offenders, Probation Before Judgment, or other Court diversion program.

To help ensure that individuals governing our charter schools have the appropriate background and qualifications, this legislation requires criminal background and child abuse registry checks for charter school board members, and it will prohibit individuals who have felony convictions or convictions for a crime against a child from serving on a charter board. Charter school board members will be required to disclose any financial interest they may have in the charter school, so that parents and others may learn and inquire about any financial arrangements benefiting a school board member. In addition, new charter schools would receive less funding at the start of the year, with the remainder of the funding provided throughout the year after a review by the Department to ensure that the finances of the school are sound. The legislation also requires an annual external audit of charter schools and adds charter schools to the Finance Recovery Team portion of the Delaware Code, which currently applies only to school districts, authorizing the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to appoint a team to assess the financial status of a charter school that is on formal review, to provide information to parents and teachers regarding status, and to make certain decisions regarding payments by the charter school. The legislation also moves up the deadline by which charter renewal decisions must be made so that, if a charter is not going to be renewed, that decision is made prior to the school choice deadline. And it creates a mechanism for permitting a high performing charter operator to open a school that would serve students at a charter school that is slated for closure, providing greater opportunities and avoiding significant disruption for the students. Using this provision, a highly successful charter school operator could apply for a new charter to serve the students at the closing charter school, and the applicant could be permitted to begin operating in less than the 18 months currently required between the filing of the application and the opening of the charter school. To facilitate this action, the legislation adds flexibility to board composition requirements, so that governing boards continue to have teacher and parent representation but are not required to have such representation from every school for which a charter is held."}, "205": {"bill_id": 337130, "number": "HB206", "change_hash": "a27c97304458932820d370c0ad29d41c", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB206/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-22", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2011-06-23", "last_action": "Reported Out of Committee (SUNSET COMMITTEE (POLICY ANALYSIS & GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY)) in House with 5 On Its Merits", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 24 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Board Of Pharmacy.", "description": "This bill grants the Board of Pharmacy authority to establish standards and procedures for the collection, destruction, return and redistribution of previously dispensed medications.

This is the internal DelDOT document that spells out the requirements and consequences for a traffic impact study. The bill provides for a few improvements to weak areas that public complaints have brought to light. The proponents of this bill have identified what they see as a problem in the interaction between DelDOT and New Castle County Land Use that divests DelDOT of authority they believe it must retain in order to be good stewards of the highways. The 2008 Memorandum of Agreement between the two agencies contained sections exempting such projects as redevelopments, work force housing, developments located in a WILMAPCO TID (traffic investment districts), and economic development in general. The exemptions and options for not doing a traffic impact study&#8212;especially when a rezoning is involved--are not acceptable to the public. This bill requires that the Memorandum of Agreement be amended by the two agencies within 90 days and sent through a public hearing. The bill sets a bottom standard for requiring a traffic impact study in what the Department calls developed or developing areas&#8212;not rural roads. That is 120 vehicles per hour (two every minute) in and out of a commercial site or 400 per day. For residential developments, 400 vehicles per day in and out of a site with entrances on 2 different roads and 200 per day for those with one. The standard is lower where a rezoning is involved&#8212;150 vehicles per day or 25 per hour will trigger one. That is because in New Castle County, a rezoning is the only chance residents have to stop a use they think will be harmful to their area, and one of the major factors is traffic. It requires a project that cannot be redeveloped without sending the road and intersection into failure to wait if the engineer cannot figure out a way to improve the situation by designing something different. For the developers, the bill requires the Department to do an internal analysis to see how they can speed up the TIS process &quot;in house.&quot; Residents of New Castle County are insisting that the Planning Board and Land Use Dept. get the traffic study data before a rezoning hearing, so the developer will have to start that before filing for it with the County. Two recent situations have inspired a requirement for DelDOT to tweak its Regulations. One is the fact that in spite of their clear rule, the engineers for developers are taking traffic counts in August when school is out. The other is that DelDOT is not paying attention to crash and safety data when deciding on traffic signals. They are required to review them to see if they can be improved with the addition of some consequences for violations of requirements. A serious safety hazard has been created by exempting work force housing from a TIS out in Mill Creek. Because no safety analysis was done, they are currently building the entrance and exit on a major federal highway where loaded trucks come barreling over a hill within a few dozen feet of the entrance at 55 mph or more. Some things can be waived for 1,000 new jobs, and the Department is told to do a TIS for them in a hurry, but the public wants the Department to be firm about requiring a TIS for significant developments no matter what the County is willing to ignore."}, "220": {"bill_id": 337865, "number": "HB221", "change_hash": "9b9afa4186bf7911a93015f0f455af27", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB221/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-28", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2011-06-30", "last_action": "Re-Assigned to House Administration Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 19 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Workplace Fraud Act.

", "description": "House Bill 214 of this General Assembly sought to convert the Delaware Code to the use of People First Language (&#8220;PFL&#8221;) as part of a national movement to promote dignity and inclusion for people with disabilities. 78 Del. Laws c. 179 (2011). During the pendency of House Bill 214, it became clear that the proposed changes to the Delaware Criminal Code should be further studied. More specifically, there was a concern that certain phrases and language present in the criminal code might have meanings unique to criminal law that had been adopted from the Model Penal Code, settled by prior decisional law or otherwise been defined by practice and custom. It had been, and remains, the purpose of House Bill 214 and this Act to adopt PFL and related changes only for the purpose of removing insensitive and offensive language from the criminal code; not to in any way effect change in the statutory definitions of conditions or circumstances described therein or Delaware&#8217;s substantive criminal law. In turn, those House Bill 214 criminal code provisions were amended out, researched and those changes deemed advisable are contained in this Act. For example, in describing one statutory aggravating circumstance in Delaware&#8217;s capital sentencing statute offensive language that labels the victim as &#8220;severely handicapped or severely disabled&#8221; now appears. This language would be changed to describe the victim instead as &#8220;particularly vulnerable due to a severe intellectual, mental or physical disability.&#8221; This change in labeling language, however, would affect no definitional or substantive change. Such a victim would, just as now, be deemed a person who suffers from a temporary or permanent physical, intellectual or mental impairment resulting from disease, an injury, a functional disorder, or a congenital condition that renders him or her incapable to adequately provide for his or her own personal care, safety or protection. So too with the phraseology &#8220;severe mental retardation&#8221; now found in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11,  4209. That phrase, which is unique to Delaware&#8217;s criminal statutes, would be updated to &#8220;profound intellectual developmental disorder.&#8221; While the label of this mitigating circumstance would be changed to this more acceptable form, again, there is absolutely no change to its legal definition, the legal burdens prescribed to prove such, or any other substantive aspect of related Delaware law. In sum, none of the changes to the labeling language brought about by this Act should be viewed to affect prior Delaware judicial or legal interpretations of the terms or phrases amended."}, "245": {"bill_id": 368430, "number": "HB246", "change_hash": "9c40cc1aedc50036f74187e2260496d0", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB246/2011", "status_date": "2012-01-17", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2012-03-13", "last_action": "Laid On Table in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 16 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Establishing A Yellow Dot Medical Information Alert Program.", "description": "This bill establishes a &#8220;Yellow Dot&#8221; medical information alert program."}, "247": {"bill_id": 377535, "number": "HB248", "change_hash": "e2b4a3ad987f384df67eb5baf313b743", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB248/2011", "status_date": "2012-06-15", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-06-15", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Educator Licensure And Certification.

First, it would close a major loophole under existing law by requiring persons, other than political candidates and parties, who engage in &#8220;electioneering communications&#8221; before an election to file a report disclosing (among other things) the sources of funding for such ads. Under current law, persons who buy campaign ads that are not coordinated with any candidate (known as &#8220;independent expenditures&#8221;) must file disclosure reports, but only if the ads expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. Persons who buy ads that do not use &#8220;magic words&#8221; such as &#8220;vote for Smith&#8221; or similar terms are not required to file reports under existing law. As a result, persons who advocate indirectly for a candidate (for example, &#8220;Call Candidate X and tell him he&#8217;s wrong on education&#8221;) are not required to file reports. This bill would close that loophole by requiring reports for electioneering communications &#8211; i.e., third party advertisements that refer to a clearly identified candidate and are publicly distributed within 30 days before a primary or special election, or 60 days before a general election. This requirement will provide crucial information to voters in the days before an election and &#8220;help citizens make informed choices in the political marketplace.&#8221; Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010). Second, this Act would require all third-party advertisements having a fair market value of $500 or more to include the following statement: &#8220;Learn more about [name of person] at [Commissioner of Elections&#8217; web address].&#8221; By informing voters that they can review the campaign finance reports filed by the person who placed the ad, this requirement will help reduce the risk or appearance of undue influence and promote compliance with existing campaign finance laws. Third, this Act would require any third party that spends $500 or more on advertisements during an election period to file a report with the Elections Commissioner within 24 hours of such expenditure. (If the expenditure occurs more than 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, the report must be filed within 48 hours.) Under existing law, independent expenditure reports must be filed within 24 hours if the expenditure occurs within 20 days of an election. Otherwise, independent expenditures are disclosed only in 30-day and 8-day reports. This revised reporting procedure will ensure more timely dissemination of critical information to voters before an election. Finally, this Act would enhance disclosure requirements by requiring entities that contribute more than $1,200 to political action committees or political parties during an election cycle to disclose the name and address of a &#8220;responsible party&#8221; &#8211; that is, someone who shares or exercises direction or control over the entity&#8217;s activities.

The Act authorizes internet gaming under the control and operation of the Delaware Lottery. The Delaware Lottery Office is authorized to conduct traditional lottery games over the internet. Delaware's video lottery agents are authorized to offer through their websites internet versions of the table games and video lottery offerings. All games shall remain operated by the Delaware Lottery. These offerings capitalize on a recent United States Department of Justice ruling clarifying that wagering within a state's boundaries does not violate federal law. The Act requires the Lottery Director to provide for the security and effective administration of internet gaming, including procedures for verifying the location and identify of players, mechanisms for maintaining account security, procedures to exclude minors or other excluded persons, limits on the amount which can be wagered, and advertisements for services for compulsive gamblers. Internet lottery games would be offered solely to persons within the State of Delaware at the current time. A person's location would be determined from a person's computer or mobile device. This territorial limitation applies to all gaming except gaming pursuant to an interstate compact or if otherwise legally authorized. Internet lottery participation would be limited to persons who meet the age requirements for equivalent non-internet games. Revenues from the internet lottery would be distributed in a manner similar to current lottery games. The internet versions of table games and video lottery games would be distributed generally pursuant to the formulae applicable to those games, with the exception that the first $3.75 million would be retained by the Lottery to ensure the proposal is at least revenue neutral to the State. As such, revenues from those games would support services for compulsive gambling and additional purse revenue for thoroughbred and standardbred racing. The Act compels the Department of Finance to conduct a study of purse revenue generally for submission to the Governor and General Assembly on or before January 30, 2013. The Department of Finance would also prepare a report for consideration by the General Assembly on or before January 30, 2016 for reevaluation of the purses generated by internet table games. The Act also restructures the fees currently paid by video lottery agents to incentivize those agents to reinvest up to $7.75 million in their improved competitiveness through capital investments and marketing plans. The Act also amends Title 4 to provide that restaurants who participate as lottery agents do not have the receipts from lottery activities counted as part of the receipts not generated by food service. The Act further authorizes the Delaware Lottery to operate the sports lottery at venues other than the video lottery agents, such as bars or convenience stores. The Lottery would prioritize applications to operate the sports lottery for those proposals most likely to foster economic growth and job creation. It also authorizes the Delaware Lottery to operate keno, a numbers game in which players select numbers and winners are chosen at regular intervals."}, "333": {"bill_id": 425288, "number": "HB334", "change_hash": "4f9b26e8f3835e8017cc13b114d5dc21", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB334/2011", "status_date": "2012-05-10", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2012-05-10", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to House Administration Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Relating To The Adoption Of Regulations.", "description": "Delaware agencies and other regulatory bodies play an ever increasing role in the governance of this State by creating regulations which have the force of law.

Under the statutes, the Insurance Department regulates a large contingent of bail bond agents. The statutes cover both surety bond bail agents, who post surety bonds issued by an insurance company, and property or cash bail agents, who post cash or property bails. Many agents operate both as surety bond bail agents and cash or property bail agents. This bill will achieve the following allow the Department and the courts to monitor more closely bail agents by requiring them all to be residents of the State of Delaware. A number of states currently have similar provisions requiring bail agents to be residents of the licensing state. Delaware residency may be established under the bill by maintaining a principal place of business in the State. Nonresident bail agents who currently are licensed and who wish to renew their licenses will be required to establish residency and successfully pass the Delaware bail agent examination when their non-resident licenses come up for renewal in 2013. This bill will restrict participation by unlicensed persons in the bail bond business by requiring disclosure to the Commissioner of the identity of each person having or seeking to acquire a ten percent or greater financial interest in a bail agent&#8217;s business or any bail bond, and by requiring any person who acquires a ten percent or greater financial interest in a bail agent&#8217;s business or a bail bond to be licensed as a bail agent. The bill also provides that any unlicensed person acting as a bail agent is guilty of a class F felony. This penalty is the same as the one imposed by 24 Del. C.  5515(b) upon any unlicensed person acting as a bail enforcement agent. This bill will also more clearly authorize the Commissioner to impose the same sanctions upon bail agents that the Commissioner may impose on all insurance producers under Title 18, section 1712, in the event of agent misconduct. Going forward the State will require criminal background checks from both the FBI and SBI in connection with initial applications for licensure, and for each biennial renewal. The current statute requires only a background check from the SBI, and only upon the initial application. The bill also establishes tighter standards for solicitation, record retention, reporting requirements, and accounting for premiums that allow for stronger regulatory oversight by the Department. Uniform standards of record retention to ensure that the Department has access to tangible records when conducting market conduct examinations of bail agents is also required. These requirements will result in more transparency in the industry. Under current law, the premiums for surety bail bonds and the commissions and other charges for cash bails must be filed with, and approved by, the commissioner. However, unscrupulous bail agents engage in a practice of &#8220;undercutting:&#8221; where in order to get business, they obtain only a limited portion of the filed rate of commission, and do not enter into a written agreement, before posting the bond. This practice allows defendants to post bond and leave detention at potentially much lower rates than the courts would expect based on the rates, charges and commissions filed with the commissioner. Under the bill, bail agents are required to collect a minimum of 7% of a surety bond amount, or 20% of a cash bail, and to enter into a written agreement before posting a bond. Also, this bill will establish clearer standards for the return of collateral to persons pledging the collateral, prohibit any bail agent from using more than two trade names, and make minor corrections and changes to the current law."}, "363": {"bill_id": 429843, "number": "HB364", "change_hash": "64ebad0a920adc23b25e588dc7a2d1d6", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/HB364/2011", "status_date": "2012-06-05", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2012-06-05", "last_action": "Introduced and Assigned to Economic Development/Banking/Insurance/Commerce Committee in House", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 18 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Audits By Pharmacy Benefit Managers.", "description": "This bill creates comprehensive requirements for the conducting of benefits managers&#8217; audits.

This system eliminates unnecessary multi-payer brokers and will save approximately 40 percent of total funds now wasted by a 30 percent loss to administrative/overhead costs (costly paperwork, profits, advertising, lobbying, etc.) and a minimum of 10 percent to unchecked health care fraud. These savings are research-documented by single payer health care systems used by our military services, Veterans Administration's health care system and our Medicare system. A typical research study by a Harvard University team showed a 33 percent administrative/overhead waste of our health care funds by insurance company brokers compared to 1.5 percent administrative/overhead cost of our single payer Medicare system. These Delaware annual savings and a stabilized funding structure with accountable budgets will enable our state to provide the following health care benefits to all citizens, our state's budget and future economic/job development: (1) Comprehensive health care coverage (physicians and specialists, hospital needs, long-term care, pharmaceutical drugs, dental care, mental health, drug rehabilitation, special equipment and aids, etc.) from conception until death without any extra health insurance or out-of-pocket expense; (2) Eliminate the huge double-digit annual increases in health care costs; only the smaller rate of inflation will apply; (3) Will return all health care decision-making to physicians, dentists and other professional health care professional staff; (4) Eliminates the pauper requirement that one must give up all savings and property before receiving Medicare/Medicaid funds for long-term care; (5) Will eliminate all health care debts, major cause of personal bankruptcies and the ability to buy or keep one's home; (6) Will eliminate the destructive, debilitating effects of chronic stress on our uninsured, under insured and their families; (7) Will serve as a magnet to both attract and retain private businesses competing in the global economy. This was the key reason we lost the Chrysler and General Motors automobile manufacturing plants; (8) In addition to providing comprehensive health care coverage for all citizens, this Act will save millions each year for our state's budget; (9) Personal health care savings by our state's citizens will add hundreds of millions to our state's annual economy; and (10) Will significantly elevate our state's ranking of from 40th or lower among all states on health care challenges such as well babies, women's health care status, cancer, etc. This Act will provide funds for three years for training and economic assistance for displaced paperwork employees who choose to fill additional needed health care service jobs created by approximately a five percent increase in health care utilization caused by this reformed health care system. This Act will be administered by a 15-member Delaware Health Security Board comprised as follows: State Secretary of Health And Social Services, appointed by the Governor; Two members from both the State House of Representatives and State Senate Committees concerned with health care issues; Five members from state health professional organizations and five members from eligible consumer organizations in our state.

These County Advisory Councils will work with and through the State's Board and four Divisions in more effectively implementing the planning, operation and evaluation of the Delaware Health Security Act. Funding for the Delaware Health Security Act will be as follows: (1) All state and federal funds available for health and health care costs in Delaware; (2) Employer and employee graduated payroll tax from 4 percent for employers with less than ten employees to 9 percent for employers with 50 or more employees; (3) A Health Security tax of 2.5 percent on net taxable income (after deductions) for all heads of households and persons subject to Delaware's income tax; and (4) An additional Health Security income surtax on net taxable income of 2.5 percent for persons filing a Delaware income tax return in excess of $250,000.

The Bill creates an exception to a state&#8217;s criminal laws to permit the doctor-recommended medical use of marijuana by patients with serious medical conditions. A patient would only be protected from arrest of controlled substance laws if his or her physician certifies, in writing, that the patient has a specified debilitating medical condition and that the patient would receive therapeutic benefit from medical marijuana. The patient would send a copy of the written certification to the state Department of Health and Social Services and the Department would issue an ID card after verifying the information. Police officers could verify an ID card&#8217;s validity with the Department. As long as the patient is in compliance with the law, there would be no arrest. Patients would be allowed to possess up to 6 ounces for their medical use. Six ounces is less than the federal government has determined is a one-month supply for patients in the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program. The legislation allows them to designate a caregiver who would also receive an ID card. Each caregiver may assist no more than five qualifying patients. The legislation would allow for the state-regulated, non-profit distribution of medical marijuana. The Department of Health and Social Services would issue registration certificates to qualified applicants, who would have to abide by the rules on security, recordkeeping, and oversight provided for by the model medical marijuana legislation, in addition to any additional rules that the Department may develop. All dispensaries would be subject to random inspection and all of their staff would have to register with the Department of health. It is important that the law provide for both caregivers and dispensaries, since patients in rural areas are unlikely to have access to dispensaries, and because many low-income patients will not be able to afford medical marijuana at dispensaries. In addition, very ill patients would need a caregiver to pick up their medicine for them. The Bill maintains commonsense restrictions on the medical use of marijuana, including prohibitions on public use of marijuana and driving under the influence of marijuana. Employers are not required to allow patients to be impaired at work or to allow the possession of marijuana at a workplace. Insurance providers would not have to cover medical marijuana."}, "531": {"bill_id": 243293, "number": "SB18", "change_hash": "6d101a22b04a9e4f32ea1a620ace5a3e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB18/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-30", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2011-06-30", "last_action": "Enact w/o Sign by Governor", "title": "An Act Concurring In A Proposed Amendment To Article Iii Of The Delaware Constitution Of 1897, As Amended, Relating To Confirmation Of Officers Appointed By The Governor.

", "description": "Recent turmoil in the financial markets has heightened scrutiny, in the capital markets and among financial institutions, about identifying, managing and limiting risk, the need for adequate capitalization and for understanding the interdependency of the different financial sectors. One source of risk to financial market participants has arisen due to the lack of certainty in the treatment of qualified financial contracts and netting agreements in the event of the insolvency of state regulated insurers. The importance of maintaining certainty among the participants in these markets has been acknowledged and addressed through changes in the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (governing the insolvency of banks), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and other federal legislation and regulatory orders, as well as in the laws of major non-U.S. jurisdictions applicable to the insurers&#8217; trading counterparties. This bill corrects this lack of certainty under the Delaware insurance laws by specifying the status of &#8220;qualified financial contracts&#8221; and the permissibility of netting under such contracts in a formal delinquency proceeding. This bill brings Delaware&#8217;s insurance law into conformance with similar provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Insurance Receivership Model Act (&#8220;IRMA&#8221;). This bill also eliminates a threat to the financial stability of Delaware insurers and addresses a competitive disadvantage of Delaware insurers vis-a-vis their competitors in other jurisdictions where netting legislation has been adopted. Qualified financial contracts and netting agreements have proven to be of great assistance to Delaware insurers during the recent market downturn in managing their risks. Given the recent experience of financial market participants, however, the lack of certainty of the treatment of these agreements and contracts in a formal delinquency proceeding now threatens the ability of Delaware insurers to continue to use qualified financial contracts and netting agreements to manage their risks and remain financially strong. Recent changes in the international capital rules for banks under the Basel II accords, events in the financial markets over the past few years and the increasingly sophisticated risk control methods of financial institutions have placed a spotlight on the lack of protections for these contracts under the insurance laws of Delaware and many other states. Without the certainty that adoption of this bill will provide, it will become difficult for the counterparties of Delaware insurers to obtain the necessary legal comfort to transact business with Delaware insurers. The consequence for Delaware insurers will be increased costs in the pricing for their transactions (due to the perceived increased risk), and potentially, lack of access to these financial instruments. An inability to continue to trade or the increase in the prices at which insurers can transact potentially threatens the competitiveness and financial strength of Delaware insurers. For these reasons, as of March 4, 2011, eleven states have already taken action to adopt legislation validating these netting arrangements for insurers and several more states are currently considering adoption of similar legislation. By providing for the enforcement of netting and closeout rights as provided in this bill for &#8220;qualified financial contracts,&#8221; Delaware will bring its insurer insolvency law into harmony with federal law and IRMA, will give both insurers and their creditors the certainty and safety they need, and will eliminate a competitive disadvantage of Delaware insurers. Section 1 of this bill confirms the power of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner to issue rules, regulations an orders relating to investments by insurers, including setting standards for the prudent use of derivative instruments and other &#8220;qualified financial contracts.&#8221; Section 2 of this bill adds new subsections (14)-(24) to  5901 of the Insurance Code, providing, for purposes of Chapter 59, definitions of specific types of financial contracts commonly used in the financial markets, including swap agreements, repurchase agreements, forward contracts, commodity contracts and securities contracts as &#8220;qualified financial contracts&#8221; and the related &#8220;netting agreements&#8221; in addition to related terms including affiliate, creditor, claimant, formal delinquency proceeding and transfer. These definitions are intended to be consistent with those used under IRMA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, applicable to bank insolvencies. Section 3 of this bill adds a new  5933 to the Insurance Code. Subsection (a) of  5933 provides for the enforcement and recognition of the contractual rights of the insurer&#8217;s counterparties under qualified financial contracts, netting agreements and related security arrangements to terminate, liquidate, accelerate and close out such contracts, to set off and net out obligations owing under such contracts, and to enforce any security rights under such agreements, free of any stay, injunction or prohibition which might otherwise apply under Chapter 59. Subsection (b) of  5933 provides for the transfer by the non-defaulting party to the receiver of any net or settlement amount owing to the insurer under a qualified financial contract. Subsection (c) of  5933 provides for the transfer of all financial contracts between an insurer and a single counterparty and its affiliates together if a bulk transfer of insurer liabilities or contracts is made by the receiver. Subsection (d) of  5933 provides for notification upon transfer of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract by the receiver. Subsection (e) of  5933 provides for validation of payments and transfers of money and property under netting agreements and qualified financial contracts made prior to the commencement of a rehabilitation, insolvency or conservation proceeding, unless such transfers were made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the insurer, the receiver or other creditors. Subsection (f) of  5933 provides that if the receiver disaffirms or repudiates any qualified financial contracts or netting agreements with a counterparty, it must disaffirm or repudiate all such contracts. Subsection (g) of  5933 provides a definition of the term &#8220;contractual right&#8217; as such term is used in this new  5933. Subsection (h) of  5933 provides that this new  5933 will not apply to affiliates of an insurer subject to proceedings under Chapter 59, unless the Commissioner has previously approved the application of  5933 to a particular affiliate. This new  5933 would apply to contracts of both general and separate accounts of insurers. Section 4 provides that upon enactment this bill would be effective immediately, except that it would only apply to a liquidation, receivership or conservatorship proceeding that commences under Chapter 59 of the Delaware Insurance Code on or after the enactment of this bill."}, "560": {"bill_id": 311074, "number": "SB47", "change_hash": "187aa6d86c9be150e8b9297b11f1db11", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB47/2011", "status_date": "2011-07-05", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-07-05", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 7 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Hunting, Trapping, And Fishing Licenses.

Existing law simply requires that a community owner provide 60 days written notice of an increase and that only 1 increase may be made per calendar year. In addition to these provisions, this Act requires that rent be reasonable and be related to the operating costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated. When a lot rent increase is proposed, this Act mandates that the home owners or their association have the opportunity to meet with the community owner or his or her representative to discuss the reasons for the increase and the possibility of a phase-in of the increase. If, following this meeting, the home owner or association is still not satisfied that the rent is reasonable and related to the operating costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated, either may petition to Governor&#8217;s Council on Manufactured Housing to appoint a mediator. Mediation is a non-binding process intended: 1 - to be an informal and non-adversarial process; 2 - to promote discussion among all parties relating to disputes over lot rent increases; 3 - to provide explanations regarding why a proposed lot rent is or is not reasonable, or does or does not reflect the operational costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated; and 4 - to facilitate a settlement of the disputed issues to the satisfaction of the parties involved. If, following mediation, one of the parties remains aggrieved by the determinations of the mediator, that party may petition the Justice of the Peace Court for the appointment of an arbiter, who shall be an attorney with an expertise in landlord/tenant law and the laws governing manufactured home communities, to consider matters left unresolved following mediation or to determine whether the proposed lot rent is or is not reasonable, or does or does not reflect the operational costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated. Arbitration is binding upon the parties and is a more formal proceeding. As with mediations, parties do not need to be represented by counsel, but may be if they choose. Upon the conclusion of arbitration proceedings, the arbiter shall produce his or her decision, findings of facts and conclusions of law in the form of an opinion letter to the parties. Within 20 days following the conclusion of arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection, an aggrieved party may appeal the matter to the Superior Court on the record to review the arbiter&#8217;s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to determine whether the arbiter abused his or her discretion. Pursuant to this Act: Lot rent that exceeds existing market conditions for the lot by more than the national average rate of inflation for the period during which the rent is due shall be presumed unreasonable. This presumption may be rebutted upon a showing that operational costs beyond the control of the manufacture home community owner which are associated with the specific rental lot, or the community within which the lot is situated, necessitate lot rent at the proposed level. - and - Market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated are determined by considering market forces absent an unequal bargaining position between manufactured home community owners and manufactured home owners (such as when a single management organization or association owns or operates multiple communities within the same geographic area) and by comparing lot rents at manufactured home communities in the competitive market that offer similar facilities, services, and amenities. A competitive market shall be defined as communities that fall within a specific geographic area where taxes, average household income, zoning, and county or state development plans are within a predetermined standard deviation. - and - Operational costs associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated are determined by examining the financial, utility, tax, and maintenance records of the individual manufactured home community and rental lot in question. This Act focuses on lot rent increases and their justification given market conditions and operational costs. It is intended to ensure that rents are reasonable and that home owners have the opportunity to be heard before they are established."}, "580": {"bill_id": 328525, "number": "SB67", "change_hash": "f2906e34804fc732c2435808274856b3", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB67/2011", "status_date": "2011-06-29", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-06-29", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 17 Of The Delaware Code To Authorize The Placement Of Memorial Signage For Certain Emergency Personnel Killed In The Line Of Duty.", "description": "This Bill specifically authorizes Michelle Smith and Stephanie Calloway&#8217;s memorial signage at the locations of their deaths to commemorate their service and the tragic loss of their lives while serving in the line of duty.

The following is a section-by-section review of the proposed amendments of the Act. Section 1. This section amends  17-102(3) of the Act to provide that a limited partnership may not register under a name that is not such as to distinguish it upon the records in the office of the Secretary of State from the name on such records of another domestic limited partnership, provided that a limited partnership registered as of July 31, 2011 under such a name need not amend its certificate of limited partnership to comply with this subsection. Section 2. This section adds a new subsection (k) to  17-104 of the Act providing that, in any certificate or other document filed with the Secretary of State, the address of the registered agent or registered office of the partnership must include the street, number, city and postal code. Section 3. This section designates all but the final sentence of  17-203 of the Act as a new subsection (a), designates the final sentence of  17-203 of the Act as a new subsection (c), and adds a new subsection (b) confirming that a certificate of correction may be filed to correct a certificate of cancellation that has been filed prior to the dissolution or the completion of winding up of a limited partnership. Section 4. This section amends  17-206(b) of the Act to confirm that a certificate may be made effective at a date or time later than its filing as specified in the certificate and to provide, for filings made on or after January 1, 2012, that such later date or time shall not be later than a time on the 180th day after the filing date. Section 5. This section amends  17-206 of the Act by adding a new subsection (f) to provide that there is no need for an amendment to a certificate of limited partnership, application for registration as a foreign limited partnership, or any other document on file with the Secretary of State before August 1, 2011, to comply with new  17-104(k) of the Act, but that any certificate or other document filed on or after August 1, 2011 and changing the address of a registered agent or registered office must comply with  17-104(k) of the Act. Section 6. This section amends  17-215 of the Act to clarify that the certificate of limited partnership domestication and the certificate of limited partnership of a non-United States entity domesticating to Delaware as a Delaware limited partnership must be filed simultaneously in the office of the Secretary of State and, to the extent such certificates are to have a post-filing effective date or time, such certificates must provide for the same effective date or time. Section 7. This section amends  17-217 of the Act to clarify that the certificate of conversion to limited partnership, the certificate of limited partnership and, as applicable, the statement of qualification of an other entity converting to a Delaware limited partnership or limited liability limited partnership must be filed simultaneously in the office of the Secretary of State and, to the extent such certificates and, as applicable, such statement are to have a post-filing effective date or time, such certificates and, as applicable, such statement must provide for the same effective date or time. Section 8. This section amends  17-302(e) of the Act to clarify the manner in which limited partners of a limited partnership may take action without a meeting. Section 9. This section amends  17-302(f) of the Act to adopt a rule different from the approach articulated in In re LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. Limited Partners Litigation, 866 A.2d 762 (Del. Ch. 2004) with respect to the application of the type of amendment provision contained in the partnership agreement at issue in that case. This amendment provides that such amendment provisions only apply to provisions expressly included in the partnership agreement and do not apply to default voting provisions of the statute unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement. This amendment is not intended to affect the interpretation of such amendment provisions as applied to provisions expressly included in the partnership agreement. Section 10. This section amends  17-405(d) of the Act to clarify the manner in which general partners of a limited partnership may take action without a meeting. Sections 11 and 13. These sections amend  17-1107(a)(2) and (a)(7) of the Act to clarify that a registered agent filing a single certificate of resignation to resign from more than one limited partnership or foreign limited partnership must pay a $2.00 fee to the Secretary of State for each limited partnership or foreign limited partnership from which the registered agent is resigning. Sections 12 and 14. These sections amend  17-1107(a)(3) and (a)(11) of the Act to provide a $50 filing fee for an instrument submitted by a limited partnership or foreign limited partnership that changes only the registered office or registered agent of the limited partnership or foreign limited partnership. Section 15. This section provides that the proposed amendments of the Act shall become effective August 1, 2011."}, "609": {"bill_id": 335205, "number": "SB96", "change_hash": "2deef1012509cd9d7ebe4e2bcff32c92", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB96/2011", "status_date": "2012-02-03", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-02-03", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Parks And Recreation Council.", "description": "This bill updates the code to define eligible members of the Parks and Recreation Council appointed by the Governor.

The primary purpose of the statute is the protection of single-family residential purchasers from entering into predatory installment sale contracts couched as seller financing. However, the term &#8220;improved or unimproved residential real estate&#8221; could be interpreted to include multi-unit residential property, such as an apartment building, or even unimproved land currently zoned or approved only for residential use but upon which office, commercial or industrial uses may be contemplated in the future. In commercial transactions, in which contracts for the sale of real property are often contingent upon the receipt of approvals necessary to develop the property, obtaining such approvals can take three or more years. Applying  314(c) of Title 25 of the Delaware Code to such transactions, thereby limiting the period within which contracts involving seller financing may remain executory to periods of six to twelve months, may allow a party to such a contract to void the contract where the other party has not yet been able to obtain the necessary approvals, thus allowing such voiding party to relieve itself of contractual obligations and in some cases receive a windfall by entering into a new contract with a different party at a higher price.

", "description": "On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Contained in its entirety within this legislation was the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010, referred to as the NRRA. The NRRA places surplus lines taxation, regulatory and licensing authority under the exclusive oversight of the home state of the insured, so that multi-state policies would have premiums taxed in just one state. Along with certain other regulatory requirements for nonadmitted insurance, the NRRA compels the establishment of nationwide uniform requirements, forms, and procedures, such as an interstate compact or agreement, that provide for the reporting, payment, collection, and allocation of premium taxes among the states. The States have 330 days from the date of enactment of the NRRA to adopt and implement the compact or otherwise establish allocation procedures. This bill describes the requirements of the NRRA and amends Chapter 19 of Title 18, Delaware&#8217;s current surplus lines law, to bring the Delaware Code into compliance with those requirements. Section 1 of the bill creates Subchapter I pertaining to findings regarding the implementation of the NRRA, establishment of single-state regulatory and taxing authority, authorization for participation in an interstate cooperative compact or agreement related to regulation of nonadmitted insurance and the collection, allocation, and distribution of premium tax; establishment of a committee to study the fiscal impact of entering into an interstate agreement; adoption of definitions found in the NRRA; and the exclusion of certain lines of business from the provisions of the chapter. Section 2 of the bill creates Subchapter II pertaining to placement and regulation of surplus lines insurance through licensed surplus lines brokers or by insureds who independently procure coverage; conditions for export of coverage; authorization for the Insurance Commissioner to set diligent search requirements; certain procedural requirements for surplus lines brokers; definition and provisions for streamlined application for certain commercial insureds; endorsement of contract and required disclosure statement ensuring that the insured is aware that the surplus lines policy is placed with a company not under the jurisdiction of the Insurance Department and no guaranty fund coverage is available; allowance for delayed surplus lines licensing if Delaware is the home state of the insured; mandated use of the NAIC national producer database for licensing; and certain records and reports required from surplus lines brokers. Section 3 amends sections of Chapter 19 pertaining to surplus lines premium tax to provide that 100% of the premium for all policies written on home state insureds, whether single-state or multi-state, is considered Delaware premium for tax purposes; provide for the payment of premium tax on independently procured nonadmitted insurance; and provide for penalties for noncompliance with tax filing requirements. Section 4 creates Subchapter III pertaining to the eligibility and regulation of nonadmitted insurers as specified in the NRRA including clarification that surplus lines insurance is exempt from rate and form approval and stating criteria for withdrawal of eligibility. Section 4 also adds a section creating the company type of Delaware domestic surplus lines insurers that are admitted insurers permitted to write surplus lines policies on Delaware risks if they are sufficiently solvent, their board of directors allows it, and the Insurance Commissioner approves. Section 5 creates Subchapter IV providing for miscellaneous material such as applicability, alteration, and repeal of this law; renaming the law; providing for penalties; and declaring urgency of enactment due to the 330 day requirement in the NRRA."}, "623": {"bill_id": 335233, "number": "SB110", "change_hash": "0f57ff9c4ddaf727abec36db428954bd", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB110/2011", "status_date": "2011-07-25", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-07-25", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend The Charter Of The Town Of Georgetown Relating To The Power To Borrow Money And Issue Bonds And Other Obligations.", "description": "This Act would amend the Charter of the Town of Georgetown to enable the borrowing from a Federal or State source if the interest rate on such borrowing is fixed at zero (0%) percent and the borrowing comes with one hundred (100%) percent forgiveness of principal upon successful completion of the project financed with funds borrowed without the requirement of a referendum or special election."}, "624": {"bill_id": 335199, "number": "SB111", "change_hash": "8b113789e996d0bf8c3645dae603776f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB111/2011", "status_date": "2011-08-30", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-08-30", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 14 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Delaware Interscholastic Athletics Association.

The bill presents extensive revisions to make the Real Estate Commission&#8217;s licensing law consistent with other Title 24 boards and commissions. In addition, the amendments include new language and terms to coincide with modern practices and to provide greater clarity for practitioners and the public. In particular, the bill replaces and updates provisions relating to Commission objectives and powers and duties, licensure requirements, reciprocity, grounds for discipline and sanctions. The bill includes a definition of the term &#8220;Comparative Market Analysis&#8221; in order to delineate the scope of permissible activities for a licensee and to clarify that a Comparative Market Analysis is not an appraisal. The bill also includes a definition of &#8220;Property Management Services&#8221; and an exemption for a provider of Property Management Services. This additional language specifies that an individual engaging in Property Management Services is exempt from the statute, except to the extent that the individual is involved in selling or leasing. The bill amends the &#8220;Powers and Duties&#8221; section of the statute in order to give the Commission the explicit authority to issue cease and desist orders and impose fines for unlicensed practice. The bill makes explicit that there are three licensure categories in the real estate profession. Currently, there are just two licensure categories referenced in the statute: broker and salesperson. The term &#8220;broker of record,&#8221; designating the individual responsible for the brokerage organization, is mentioned only in the Commission&#8217;s Rules and Regulations. The bill designates the three licensure categories as Broker (formerly broker of record), Associate Broker (formerly broker) and Salesperson. These three terms will create greater protection for the public by making clear that the Broker is the individual ultimately responsible for the real estate transaction. The bill also creates standards for reciprocal licensure. Currently, out-of-state applicants are issued non-resident licenses. The amendment creates several methods whereby an out-of-state applicant may obtain a Delaware license. The bill also adds requirements for licensure for all applicants to ensure that the Commission has the authority to consider the applicant&#8217;s disciplinary history in other jurisdictions. The bill gives the Commission the authority to grant additional licenses to licensees, where the Brokers are notified and agree with the arrangement. This amendment brings Delaware into line with practices in other states. The bill also requires licensees to disclose, at the time of renewal, any criminal convictions since the last renewal. With respect to disciplinary matters, the bill gives the Commission the authority to permanently revoke a license. The bill also includes a provision for temporary suspension of a license, pending a hearing, where the activity of the licensee presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, welfare or safety. The new provision gives the authority to temporarily suspend a license to the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Commission Chairperson. The bill gives the public easier access to the Guaranty Fund. Currently, an aggrieved party must file a claim with the Guaranty Fund within 60 days after filing a lawsuit. Pursuant to the amendment to the statute, an aggrieved party must give notice within 60 days after obtaining a judgment. The bill significantly amends the statute in connection with agency relationships to afford greater protection to the public. With the amendments, statutory agency will be presumed and not predicated on the signing of the consumer information statement. Further, statutory agency begins on first contact between the licensee and the member of the public. With this amendment, the member of the public will be afforded a range of protections, such as the duty of confidentiality. This bill becomes effective six months after its enactment into law."}, "668": {"bill_id": 337293, "number": "SB155", "change_hash": "fcb4956c52731453c5e31ce156ad0c53", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB155/2011", "status_date": "2011-07-27", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2011-07-27", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Titles 11, 16, 18 And 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Office Of Narcotics And Dangerous Drugs And The Delaware State Police Drug Diversion Unit.", "description": "This legislation will make it clear that the office of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, formerly a part of the Department of Health and Social Services, is now a unit within the Division of State Police existing command structure and that the agents transferred to the Department of Safety and Homeland Security from the Department of Health and Social Services are non-merit employees and did not retain their former merit status after the transfer."}, "670": {"bill_id": 358008, "number": "SB157", "change_hash": "c52c925003214f83b87417d1b8dada64", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB157/2011", "status_date": "2012-05-15", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-05-15", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act To Amend Title 29 Of The Delaware Code Relating To The Public Officers And Employees Healthcare Insurance Program.", "description": "This Act limits the health insurance options to survivors of pensioners who are collecting survivor benefits effective on or after January 1, 2012 to only that survivor and any dependent children.

Many times first responders witness the death or serious injury to persons such as a young child or a fellow officer, become involved in a duty related shooting or in the investigation of a case where there has been a death or serious bodily injury inflicted upon a person. For example, stress caused by critical incidents have led to the law enforcement profession experiencing the second highest divorce rate in the nation. Similarly, police officers have one of the highest suicide rates among all professionals, and are more susceptible to domestic violence than those not affiliated with police work. Any first responder may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after experiencing a critical incident, or after being exposed over a period of time to stress that he or she was unable to alleviate. PTSD can be debilitating to a first responder&#8217;s ability to function effectively in response to an emergency. This bill creates a confidentiality privilege between the first responder and a Critical Incident Stress Management team or team member to encourage first responders to seek stress management services in order to alleviate the high levels of stress they may experience as a result of their exposure to a critical incident so that they may continue to function effectively during emergency situations. CISM teams and team members are primarily comprised of first responders who have received training and certification from a nationally accredited CISM organization or network on peer-to-peer counseling. Peer-to-peer counseling is critical to the public safety as well as to safety and well-being of the first responder in that it is based upon trust and the confidence that comes from knowing that the officer is speaking with a peer who has had similar experiences with critical incidents. Imperative to the success of peer-to-peer counseling is confidentiality of a first responders&#8217; statements given at the time CISM counseling is obtained by the first responder. A CISM counselor may not be compelled to testify in any legal proceeding as to statements made by a first responder who has received CISM counseling from the counselor to the extent that the statements are made during the course of a recognized CISM counseling session. The criteria for the privilege to attach are as follows: 1. The person holding the privilege must be a first responder; 2. The first responder must be acting in the course of his duties at the time he or she is exposed to the incident; 3. The first responder must have received CISM counseling as a result of a critical incident; 4. The CISM counselor must: a. Be certified by a nationally accredited Critical Incident Stress Management organization or network which has been recognized by the Council on Police Training;"}, "688": {"bill_id": 381821, "number": "SB175", "change_hash": "7c87113d773d26a3df45ce15d7f794c2", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB175/2011", "status_date": "2012-01-26", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2012-01-26", "last_action": "Assigned to Finance Committee in Senate", "title": "An Act Making Appropriations For The Expense Of The State Government For The Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2013; Specifying Certain Procedures, Conditions And Limitations For The Expenditure Of Such Funds; And Amending Certain Pertinent Statutory Provisions.", "description": "This Bill is the Fiscal Year 2013 Appropriation Act."}, "689": {"bill_id": 417522, "number": "SB176", "change_hash": "3c46bdcef87ed5acfe1b7191c7696526", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB176/2011", "status_date": "2012-06-05", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2012-06-05", "last_action": "SS 1 for SB 176 - Passed by House of Representatives.

This Bill results in Delaware domiciled risk retention groups (RRGs) complying with uniform standards established for all RRGs and will ensure compliance with the Part A accreditation standards for RRGs, which became required on January 1, 2011. It makes RRGs subject to similar policyholder protections applied to traditional coverage. Failure to adopt this Bill will cause Delaware to lose its accreditation. This Bill also limits an RRG from concentrating its coverage of risk on a single risk or policyholder. Consequently, this limitation prevents a material financial loss in the event the single risk has adverse insurance experience by mandating a spreading of the risk by making RRGs subject to Chapter 18, Title 18. The Bill&#8217;s changes are pursuant to the NAIC Insurance Holding Company Systems Regulatory Act and the NAIC Model Risk Retention Act. It will result in Delaware domiciled RRGs complying with uniform standards established for all RRGs and will ensure compliance with the Part A accreditation standards for RRGs, which became required on January 1, 2011. It further makes RRGs comport with the rules governing managing general agents, which typically not only have the authority to solicit and sell insurance coverage, but they can also have expanded authority to settle claims, negotiate reinsurance, issue policies, or handle regulatory compliance, by making RRGs subject to Subchapter III of Chapter 9, Title 18. It mandates that RRGs comply with the credit for reinsurance statute which results in RRGs properly using reinsurance as a means to transfer risk, by making RRGs subject to Chapter 16, Title 18. The Bill also mandates that reinsurance brokers who assist RRGs in placing reinsurance are licensed as reinsurance intermediaries.

This section amends  3801(c) of the Act to confirm that the governing instrument of a statutory trust must be written but is not governed by any statute of frauds. Section 2. This section amends  3801(g) of the Act to confirm the broad power of a statutory trust to grant, hold or otherwise exercise a power of attorney. Section 3. This section amends  3804 of the Act to clarify the circumstances under which a statutory trust may be sued for the acts of its trustees or other authorized persons and agents acting on behalf of the foregoing in the performance of their duties under the governing instrument of the statutory trust.

Ch. 2004) with respect to the application of the type of amendment provision contained in the partnership agreement at issue in that case. This amendment provides that such amendment provisions only apply to provisions expressly included in the governing instrument of a statutory trust and do no apply to the default voting provision of the Act unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument. This amendment is not intended to affect the interpretation of such amendment provisions as applied to provisions expressly included in the governing instrument. Section 5. This section amends  3806(f)(1) of the Act to clarify the manner in which beneficial owners of a statutory trust may take action without a meeting. Section 6. This section amends  3806(g)(1) of the Act to clarify the manner in which trustees of a statutory trust may take action without a meeting. Section 7. This section amends  3808(f) of the Act by clarifying that the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a trustee will not result in the termination or dissolution of a series of a statutory trust unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument. Section 8. This section amends  3810(d) of the Act by confirming that a certificate of correction may be filed to correct a certificate of cancellation that has been filed prior to the dissolution or completion of winding up of a statutory trust. Section 9. This section amends  3810 of the Act by establishing a method for any creditor, beneficial owner or trustee of a cancelled statutory trust and certain other persons to apply to the Court of Chancery for the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take charge of the statutory trust&#8217;s property, and prosecute or defend all suits and do all other acts which might be done by the statutory trust, if in being, that may be necessary for the final settlement of the unfinished business of the statutory trust. Section 10. This section amends  3811 of the Act to revise the section title. Section 11. This section amends  3811 of the Act to clarify, for purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware, when a power of attorney will be irrevocable, and the effects of such irrevocability. Section 12. This section amends  3815(a) of the Act to clarify the requirement for approval of an agreement of merger or consolidation by a statutory trust. Section 13. This section amends  3815(b)(1) of the Act by adding a new requirement to provide the type of business entity involved in a merger or consolidation. Section 14. This section amends  3815(f) of the Act to remove inconsistent language. Section 15. This section amends  3816(a) of the Act to expand the language regarding who has authority to bring an action to recover a judgment from &#8220;trustees with authority&#8221; to &#8220;persons with authority.&#8221; Section 16. This section amends  3816(c) of the Act to expand the language regarding who has authority to bring an action to recover a judgment from &#8220;trustees with authority&#8221; to &#8220;persons with authority.&#8221; Section 17.

This section amends  3819(a) of the Act to expand the language regarding the persons from whom a beneficial owner may request certain information about the statutory trust and who may establish standards governing what information and documents are to be furnished at what time and location and at whose expense to include &#8220;other persons who have authority to manage the business and affairs of the statutory trust.&#8221; Section 19. This section amends  3820(b)(2) of the Act by adding a new requirement to provide the type of business entity converting to a Delaware statutory trust. Section 20. This section amends  3823(b)(7) of the Act to clarify that the address provided for service of process may not be that of the statutory trust&#8217;s registered agent, as applicable, without the written consent of such registered agent. Section 21. This section amends  3825 of the Act to provide that a governing instrument that provides for the application of Delaware law shall be governed and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware in accordance with its terms. This amendment is not intended to negate the application of Delaware law to the interpretation and enforcement of a governing instrument that does not explicitly provide for the application of Delaware law or to negate the application of the internal affairs doctrine to Delaware statutory trusts.

Courts in this state have consistently held that when an insurer rescinds a life insurance policy, the insurer must return the premiums that it has collected on the policy. See, e.g., Strassburger v. Earley, 752 A.2d 557, 578 (Del.Ch.2000); Lincoln Nat&#8217;l Ins. Co. v. Snyder, 722 F. Supp. 2d 546, 565 (D. Del. 2010); Oglesby v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 877 F.Supp. 872, 890 (D.Del.1994) Some insurers, however, have ignored this well-settled rule and continue to file lawsuits that seek to rescind the life insurance policies they issued and allow them to keep the premiums paid on those policies. This bill eliminates any possible uncertainty about the state of the law by adopting the common-law rule that an insurer cannot rescind a life insurance policy issued in this State unless it refunds the premiums to the owner of the policy. The bill also advances three other goals that are important to Delaware consumers. First, it provides necessary certainty to investors who purchase life insurance policies in the secondary market. That market, in turn, benefits Delaware consumers&#8212;and particularly senior citizens&#8212;by giving them the chance to sell a life insurance policy that they no longer want or need for a substantially higher price than the cash surrender value of the policy. Second, the bill eliminates &#8220;the undesirable effect of incentivizing insurance companies to bring rescission suits as late as possible as they continue to collect premiums at no actual risk.&#8221; Snyder, 722 F. Supp. 2d at 565. Third, the bill eliminates the risk of expensive and unnecessary litigation for owners of life insurance policies issued in this state by establishing a clear and unambiguous rule that is consistent with existing case law."}, "734": {"bill_id": 426839, "number": "SB221", "change_hash": "f2e57ff3359fb2b0ff30091f6573bd0a", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB221/2011", "status_date": "2012-06-26", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2012-07-05", "last_action": "Enact w/o Sign by Governor", "title": "An Act Proposing An Amendment To Article Iv, Section 11 Of The Delaware Constitution Of 1897, As Amended Relating To Certification Of Questions Of Law To The Supreme Court.", "description": "This amendment adds the United States Bankruptcy Courts to the list of entities that may certify questions of law to the Delaware Supreme Court.

The Act promotes informed decision-making in the criminal justice system by institutionalizing the use of evidenced-based practices in decisions concerning bail, rehabilitation and probation supervision and helps ensure scarce resources are focused on higher-risk offenders. The Task Force recommends the use of a pretrial risk assessment tool to inform release decisions. The Act provides for implementation of an objective assessment instrument that gauges defendants&#8217; risk of flight and re-arrest to help magistrates make informed about the terms or conditions of pre-trial release. The instrument would incorporate elements to ensure the safety of victims of domestic and sexual violence. In addition, the Act requires the Statistical Analysis Center to provide magistrates with data on rates of re-arrest and failures to appear for a scheduled court date. This would create a track record for release decisions, helping to improve future decision-making. The Task Force recommends holding offenders accountable. The Act provides that court-ordered investigations should include use of an objective risk and needs assessment tool by the Department of Correction, which would be required to create a case plan for higher risk individuals. The Act also amends when the Department of Correction can reclassify offenders sentenced to Supervision Levels I, II, or III upon administration of an objective risk and need assessment instrument. The Act clarifies that the Department of Correction may use home confinement to resolve technical and minor violations of probation or supervision. The Act clarifies that upon release from Level V incarceration, the offender shall be deemed to have served the entire period of incarceration and shall be supervised in the community if the sentence requires. To incentivize completion of evidence-based programs that reduce recidivism, offenders may reduce time served by up to 60 days per year if programs are completed successfully. Offenders under community supervision may earn credit for successful compliance with conditions of probation. The Task Force recommends the use of evidence-based programs and assessment tools to direct resources toward programs that improve outcomes. The Act provides that the Department of Correction will use a risk assessment instrument for case planning and will use evidence-based programs to reduce offender risk. Further, the Act directs the Department of Correction to evaluate the availability of community-based programs that reduce risk of re-offense. The Statistical Analysis Center shall annually produce a recidivism report of one-year two-year and three-year rates of re-arrest, reconviction and recommitment of released offender cohorts.

This change to Article I, Section 12 would permit Delaware to achieve consistency with federal law and practice, as well as, that of many other states. Decision-making by any court regarding detention would have to be made on an individualized, fact-governed basis in order to pass muster under both the Federal and Delaware Constitutions. Federal constitutional law permits pre-trial detention based on the premise that certain defendants would continue to victimize members of the community while released on bail pending trial.

Energy efficiency investments create in-state jobs, lower energy bills for Delaware consumers and businesses, prevent dollars from being sent across borders, encourage the development of skilled energy professionals and labor force in Delaware, stimulate innovation, and cause a reinvestment of Delaware dollars in Delaware. Efficiency investments lead to substantial environmental and health benefits from reduced air pollution, make homes healthier and more comfortable, increase grid reliability, decrease vulnerability to energy price spikes, increase energy security, and boost the economy. The Bill permits electricity providers to utilize electric energy efficiency savings achieved above and beyond the existing electric energy efficiency goals (15% by 2015) toward achieving their renewable energy portfolio standard requirements. Reducing electricity consumption has the same positive attributes as renewable energy resources and through the process set forth in this Bill, will result in actual reductions in overall customer bills. Adding another option for complying with Delaware&#8217;s renewable portfolio standards gives energy utilities greater flexibility in how they meet this renewable requirement while still providing the many positive benefits to Delaware citizens as previously defined in the statute. Additionally, the increased flexibility in complying with the renewable portfolio standards could also result in a lower cost to achieve those requirements. In response to the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) Workgroup&#8217;s report, the Bill clarifies and simplifies the EERS Act. This Bill establishes an alternative compliance pathway for affected energy providers to meet the energy efficiency goals of the EERS Act. The alternative compliance pathway enables the achievement of the targets through the identification of all cost-effective, reliable, and feasible energy efficiency and coincident peak demand reduction programs that reduce the average customer&#8217;s energy bill. The new alternative compliance pathway complements the Act&#8217;s existing efficiency goals by ensuring energy efficiency and coincident peak demand reduction investments are cost effective, reliable, feasible, and are the least expensive ways to meet the growing energy demands of the state. The Bill also eliminates the authority to impose an energy efficiency surcharge. Energy efficiency is instead treated as an energy resource and is paid for in the same manner as other supply resources, with an assurance that only programs designed to reduce the average customer&#8217;s bills will be implemented. A rigorous financial oversight structure is established to ensure that only programs that reduce customer bills are approved. The Bill would reduce energy costs while increasing reliability and energy security for the state. A final component of the Bill synchronizes the Integrated Resource Planning process for regulated utilities with the energy efficiency planning process."}, "778": {"bill_id": 431548, "number": "SB265", "change_hash": "6b515882106041a78105b81b54e9cc63", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SB265/2011", "status_date": "2012-07-01", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2012-07-01", "last_action": "Signed by Governor", "title": "An Act Making Appropriations For Certain Grants-in-aid For The Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2013; Specifying Certain Procedures, Conditions And Limitations For The Expenditure Of Such Funds, Amending The Fiscal Year 2013 Appropriations Act.

All the members of the first American cabinet had Scottish ancestry. Delaware&#8217;s first governor &#8211; John McKinly, was born in Northern Ireland of Scottish descent. Americans of Scottish descent have played a vibrant and influential role in the development of this country. However, not until 1997 was this influence recognized by a single-year U.S. Senate Resolution that appeared in the Congressional Record of April 7, 1997. In 1998 National Tartan Day was officially recognized on a permanent basis when the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 155 recognizing April 6th as National Tartan Day. This was followed by companion bill House Resolution 41 which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 9, 2005. President George W. Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation on April 4, 2008 making April 6 National Tartan Day. In April of 2008, then Governor Minner issued a statement celebrating the accomplishments of Scots-Irish Americans in the First State as part of a Scots/Scots-Irish Heritage Month. April 6 commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which asserted Scotland's sovereignty over English territorial claims, and which was a significant influence on the American Declaration of Independence. Canada has been celebrating &quot;National Tartan Day&quot; since 1993. The idea and motivation for creating a similar American holiday was provided by the Scottish Coalition, a group of national Scottish- American cultural organizations."}, "801": {"bill_id": 302185, "number": "SR13", "change_hash": "6175cb80a1f205b78ff89fea088eb1a8", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SR13/2011", "status_date": "2011-04-14", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2011-04-14", "last_action": "Passed by Senate.

All the members of the first American cabinet had Scottish ancestry. Delaware&#8217;s first governor &#8211; John McKinly, was born in Northern Ireland of Scottish descent. Americans of Scottish descent have played a vibrant and influential role in the development of this country. However, not until 1997 was this influence recognized by a single-year U.S. Senate Resolution that appeared in the Congressional Record of April 7, 1997. In 1998 National Tartan Day was officially recognized on a permanent basis when the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 155 recognizing April 6th as National Tartan Day. This was followed by companion bill House Resolution 41 which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 9, 2005. President George W. Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation on April 4, 2008 making April 6 National Tartan Day. In April of 2008, then Governor Minner issued a statement celebrating the accomplishments of Scots-Irish Americans in the First State as part of a Scots/Scots-Irish Heritage Month. April 6 commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which asserted Scotland's sovereignty over English territorial claims, and which was a significant influence on the American Declaration of Independence. Canada has been celebrating &quot;National Tartan Day&quot; since 1993. The idea and motivation for creating a similar American holiday was provided by the Scottish Coalition, a group of national Scottish- American cultural organizations."}, "843": {"bill_id": 422846, "number": "SCR32", "change_hash": "918b703658e59c13ce6ede4a189644bc", "url": "https://legiscan.com/DE/bill/SCR32/2011", "status_date": "2012-04-26", "status": 2, "last_action_date": "2012-04-26", "last_action": "Passed in House by Voice Vote", "title": "Commending The Delaware State Dental Society On The Achievements Of Its Ninth Annual Give Kids A Smile Program, And Recognizing Its Continuing Efforts.
