This amendment would allow such filings, once found to be contrary to the prohibited conduct by a court, to then be addressed in the same manner as other prison discipline. This would allow courts to effectively screen cases while allowing prison officials to address discipline, and would close the loophole in existence for offenders with life sentences. The purpose of the new section is to impose upon prisoners an incentive to stop and think about the merits of advancing an administrative complaint.
