This bill provides that those employers would continue to be governed by federal law governing maximum hours and overtime as provided under existing law. The bill would also provide a consistent operative date for the substantive provisions of the amendments to the affected sections, all to be effective after December 31, 2014. Finally, the bill would require legislative rules, specify the authority of the commissioner to enforce rules, and authorize emergency rules prior to January 1, 2015, to implement and administer the
