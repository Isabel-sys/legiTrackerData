The bill replaces a transformative intervention framework with multi-tiered system of support addressing both reading and mathematics. It includes the use of screening and/or benchmark assessments approved by the State Board to be administered three time throughout the school year. The bill specifies the services to be provided to students who exhibit substantial deficiencies on the screening and /or benchmark assessment and the information and notice to the parent or guardian. It requires professional development for the teachers and the training and instruction be provided by education preparation programs that prepare candidates seeking licensure for elementary education. The bill requires the retention in third grade of public school students who demonstrate minimal grade level understanding and ability upon recommendation of teacher and student assistance team, with exceptions. Students starting in the fourth grade who score below proficient in English language arts or mathematics on general summative assessment will continue to be provided intervention until they are grade level proficient. Finally, the bill requires an early childhood classroom assistant teacher in first, second and third grade classrooms that have more than 12 pupils. Note that requirements currently exist in State Board Policy 2510 for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms with more than 10 pupils to have an early childhood classroom assistant teacher and these provisions would be added to the statute in this bill. The school aid formula allowance for service personnel is amended to increase the number of state funded positions per 1,000 students in net enrollment to provide state funding for the added positions. A new section of code is added which requires early childhood classroom assistant teachers to exercise authority and control over students such as required of a teacher, but only in instances enumerated by the principal and excluding suspensions, expulsions and performing instructional duties as a teacher."}, "3": {"bill_id": 1656137, "number": "HB2004", "change_hash": "536591b8a57b8cf9fd3b577aa34f6b6b", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2004/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-10", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2023-03-22", "last_action": "To Governor 3/22/2023", "title": "Prevent the use of payment card processing systems for surveillance of Second Amendment activity and discriminatory conduct", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to prevent the use of payment card processing systems for surveillance of Second Amendment activity and discriminatory conduct."}, "4": {"bill_id": 1655937, "number": "HB2005", "change_hash": "4ba474b64c4728bf8ce5d2dd4481e7b7", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2005/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-11", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2023-03-11", "last_action": "Approved by Governor 3/21/2023 - Senate Journal", "title": "Establishing the dual enrollment pilot program to be administered by the Higher Education Policy Commission and the Council for Community and Technical College Education in conjunction with the State Board of Education.", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to establish the dual enrollment pilot program to be administered by the Higher Education Policy Commission and the Council for Community and Technical College Education in conjunction with the State Department of Education."}, "5": {"bill_id": 1655809, "number": "HB2006", "change_hash": "1eef2891cb9141243f5df823eae24132", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2006/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-06", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2023-03-04", "last_action": "Approved by Governor 3/4/2023", "title": "Relating to reorganizing the Department of Health and Human Resources", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to reorganize the Department of Health and Human Resources."}, "6": {"bill_id": 1656233, "number": "HB2007", "change_hash": "29a120352caacdfdea4223019d33072e", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2007/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-11", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2023-03-22", "last_action": "To Governor 3/22/2023", "title": "Prohibiting certain medical practices", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to prohibit certain medical practices."}, "7": {"bill_id": 1656127, "number": "HB2008", "change_hash": "8c5d87ebfb691ff82613f8c58d825eb1", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2008/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-11", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2023-03-22", "last_action": "To Governor 3/22/2023", "title": "Requiring local entities to enforce immigration laws", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to require all local entities of this state to enforce immigration laws.

This bill adds mathematics to existing programs and goals from kindergarten to third grade and incorporates science of reading instruction, which can include phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Furthermore, this bill requires Pre-K level teachers and staff to utilize early learning reporting systems and requires benchmark assessments or screeners for kindergarten through third grade in reading and mathematics to determine proficiency. Additionally, third grade students who have nonproficient scores in mathematics or the English language arts on the West Virginia General Summative Assessment must continue with intervention programs until he or she is grade level proficient. The bill emphasizes the importance of the students' support systems both in the classrooms and at home. Thus, this bill maximizes family engagement by requiring open and honest communication between the school, the student, and the students' parents or guardians. By the end of the third grade, if the student is still unable to meet minimums requirements by the end of the third grade, the teachers and the student assistance team may recommend that the student be held back. This bill provides additional classroom social, emotional, and academic support for first, second, and third grade pupils by requiring an early childhood classroom assistant teacher in first, second, and third grade classrooms that have more than 12 pupils. The school aid formula allowance for service personnel is amended to increase the number of state funded positions. This bill requires early childhood classroom assistant teachers to exercise authority and control over students such as required of a teacher, but only in instances enumerated by the principal and excluding suspensions and expulsions and performing instructional duties as a teacher. This bill also creates the Grow Your Own West Virginia Pathway to Teaching Program to improve recruitment, retention, and diversity of educators in West Virginia public schools. The Program establishes a process to be administered by the West Virginia Department of Education. Any West Virginia school district can apply to establish its own unique Grow Your Own Pathway Program. Applicants must provide a detailed explanation of how their proposed Program will be run, including partnerships with institutions of high education and whether the Program anticipates providing last dollar tuition and related educational financial assistance to candidates accepted into their Program who commit to teaching a minimum of 3 years, upon licensure, in the Applicant's school district. In evaluating applications that meet the West Virginia Department of Education's criteria, if funding is limited, the Department will give additional weight to Applicants that prioritize recruiting candidates from high-need schools, placing teacher candidates in high-need schools, develop programs that support teacher professionals, including bilingual candidates and those without bachelor's degrees, and leverage apprenticeship and year-long teacher residency models. The West Virginia Department of Education will annually provide Program data to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability including the number of Program applications, the number of programs supported including names of districts, and retention rate for educator candidates hired by the district."}, "1030": {"bill_id": 1679539, "number": "HB3036", "change_hash": "dd8960196e2cec398efdbca0013543bf", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3036/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-09", "status": 3, "last_action_date": "2023-03-11", "last_action": "House received Senate message", "title": "Increasing the number of districts and the limit on approved costs under the BUILD WV Act", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to increase the number of districts and the limit on approved costs under the BUILD WV Act."}, "1031": {"bill_id": 1679526, "number": "HB3037", "change_hash": "ce2f04407c25334b04da0b0d10a63f9f", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3037/2023", "status_date": "2023-01-25", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2023-01-25", "last_action": "To House Judiciary", "title": "To create a partisan election for county board of education members.", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to allow partisan elections for county board of education members."}, "1032": {"bill_id": 1679714, "number": "HB3038", "change_hash": "696c040c04d815305e27d0e7761254d5", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3038/2023", "status_date": "2023-01-25", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2023-01-25", "last_action": "To House Judiciary", "title": "Add unborn persons to the definition of driving under the influence and causing injury or death to an unborn person.", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to establish the felony offenses of driving a motor vehicle while impaired causing the death of an unborn fetus or causing serious bodily injury to an unborn fetus and prescribes penalties for the offenses; the bill also increases the penalties for the felony offenses of driving impaired causing death or causing serious bodily injury to any person."}, "1033": {"bill_id": 1679691, "number": "HB3039", "change_hash": "02e2039607eac66d296d35ee88145ff4", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3039/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-11", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2023-03-16", "last_action": "Approved by Governor 3/16/2023", "title": "Making a supplementary appropriation to Adjutant General - State Militia", "description": "The purpose of this supplemental appropriation bill is to supplement, amend and add a new item of appropriation in the aforesaid account for the designated spending unit for expenditure during the fiscal year 2023."}, "1034": {"bill_id": 1679602, "number": "HB3040", "change_hash": "94da569180cf4218d5a1fd9d4a1f3501", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3040/2023", "status_date": "2023-03-11", "status": 4, "last_action_date": "2023-03-16", "last_action": "Approved by Governor 3/16/2023", "title": "Supplementing and amending appropriations to the Department of Administration, Office of the Secretary", "description": "The purpose of this supplemental appropriation bill is to add a new item of appropriation in the aforesaid account for the designated spending unit for expenditure during the fiscal year 2023."}, "1035": {"bill_id": 1679472, "number": "HB3041", "change_hash": "4e27adaaf80aa5d0a16d0d4b03120d5d", "url": "https://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB3041/2023", "status_date": "2023-01-25", "status": 1, "last_action_date": "2023-01-25", "last_action": "To House Judiciary", "title": "Permitting civil remedies for the unauthorized disclosure of intimate images", "description": "The purpose of this bill is to permit a civil action for the unauthorized disclosure of an intimate image.
