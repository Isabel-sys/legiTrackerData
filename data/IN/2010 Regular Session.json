Provides that the department is responsible for these costs and expenses if a juvenile court places a child in a home or facility that is located outside Indiana and the: (1) juvenile court makes written findings based on clear and convincing evidence that the out-of-state placement is appropriate because there is not a comparable facility with adequate services located in Indiana, the location of the home or facility is within a distance not greater than 50 miles from the county of residence of the child, or the placement is recommended or approved by the director of the department or the director's designee; and (2) the placement is less expensive than similar services that can be provided in Indiana. Provides procedural rights and duties for certain determinations made by the department regarding rates for reimbursement of certain entities. Requires the department to adopt rules regarding the determination of rates for reimbursement of certain entities. Makes a technical correction. Makes other changes.
